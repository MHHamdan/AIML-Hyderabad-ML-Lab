Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.\\n\\nEnter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nAnd I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death\\nanew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to\\nwhom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,\\nsir, a father: he that so generally is at all times\\ngood must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose\\nworthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather\\nthan lack it where there is such abundance.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWhat hope is there of his majesty's amendment?\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nHe hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose\\npractises he hath persecuted time with hope, and\\nfinds no other advantage in the process but only the\\nlosing of hope by time.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nThis young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that\\n'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was\\nalmost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so\\nfar, would have made nature immortal, and death\\nshould have play for lack of work. Would, for the\\nking's sake, he were living! I think it would be\\nthe death of the king's disease.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was\\nhis great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nHe was excellent indeed, madam: the king very\\nlately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he\\nwas skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge\\ncould be set up against mortality.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nA fistula, my lord.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nI heard not of it before.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman\\nthe daughter of Gerard de Narbon?\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my\\noverlooking. I have those hopes of her good that\\nher education promises; her dispositions she\\ninherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where\\nan unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there\\ncommendations go with pity; they are virtues and\\ntraitors too; in her they are the better for their\\nsimpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\n'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise\\nin. The remembrance of her father never approaches\\nher heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all\\nlivelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;\\ngo to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect\\na sorrow than have it.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nModerate lamentation is the right of the dead,\\nexcessive grief the enemy to the living.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excess\\nmakes it soon mortal.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nMadam, I desire your holy wishes.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nHow understand we that?\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\\nIn manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue\\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\\nShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\\nDo wrong to none: be able for thine enemy\\nRather in power than use, and keep thy friend\\nUnder thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,\\nBut never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,\\nThat thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\\nFall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;\\n'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,\\nAdvise him.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\n          He cannot want the best\\nThat shall attend his love.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nHeaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\\nExit\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\n[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in\\nyour thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable\\nto my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nFarewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of\\nyour father.\\nExeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nO, were that all! I think not on my father;\\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\\nI have forgot him: my imagination\\nCarries no favour in't but Bertram's.\\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\\nIf Bertram be away. 'Twere all one\\nThat I should love a bright particular star\\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me:\\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\\nThe ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\\nMust die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,\\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\\nIn our heart's table; heart too capable\\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour:\\nBut now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy\\nMust sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?\\nEnter PAROLLES\\nAside\\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake;\\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\\nYet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,\\nThat they take place, when virtue's steely bones\\nLook bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see\\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nSave you, fair queen!\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nAnd you, monarch!\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nAnd no.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nAre you meditating on virginity?\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me\\nask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how\\nmay we barricado it against him?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nKeep him out.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,\\nin the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some\\nwarlike resistance.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nThere is none: man, sitting down before you, will\\nundermine you and blow you up.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and\\nblowers up! Is there no military policy, how\\nvirgins might blow up men?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be\\nblown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with\\nthe breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It\\nis not politic in the commonwealth of nature to\\npreserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\\nincrease and there was never virgin got till\\nvirginity was first lost. That you were made of is\\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost\\nmay be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is\\never lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nI will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nThere's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the\\nrule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,\\nis to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible\\ndisobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:\\nvirginity murders itself and should be buried in\\nhighways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\\noffendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,\\nmuch like a cheese; consumes itself to the very\\nparing, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\\nBesides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of\\nself-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose\\nby't: out with 't! within ten year it will make\\nitself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the\\nprincipal itself not much the worse: away with 't!\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nLet me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it\\nlikes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with\\nlying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't\\nwhile 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.\\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out\\nof fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just\\nlike the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not\\nnow. Your date is better in your pie and your\\nporridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,\\nyour old virginity, is like one of our French\\nwithered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,\\n'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;\\nmarry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nNot my virginity yet [         ]\\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\\nA mother and a mistress and a friend,\\nA phoenix, captain and an enemy,\\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;\\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,\\nThat blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--\\nI know not what he shall. God send him well!\\nThe court's a learning place, and he is one--\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nWhat one, i' faith?\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nThat I wish well. 'Tis pity--\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nWhat's pity?\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nThat wishing well had not a body in't,\\nWhich might be felt; that we, the poorer born,\\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\\nMight with effects of them follow our friends,\\nAnd show what we alone must think, which never\\nReturn us thanks.\\nEnter Page\\n\\nPage\\n\\nMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\\nExit\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nLittle Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I\\nwill think of thee at court.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nUnder Mars, I.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nI especially think, under Mars.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nWhy under Mars?\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nThe wars have so kept you under that you must needs\\nbe born under Mars.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nWhen he was predominant.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nWhen he was retrograde, I think, rather.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nWhy think you so?\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nYou go so much backward when you fight.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nThat's for advantage.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nSo is running away, when fear proposes the safety;\\nbut the composition that your valour and fear makes\\nin you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nI am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee\\nacutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the\\nwhich, my instruction shall serve to naturalize\\nthee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's\\ncounsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon\\nthee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and\\nthine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When\\nthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast\\nnone, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,\\nand use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.\\nExit\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\\nWhich we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\\nGives us free scope, only doth backward pull\\nOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\\nWhat power is it which mounts my love so high,\\nThat makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\\nThe mightiest space in fortune nature brings\\nTo join like likes and kiss like native things.\\nImpossible be strange attempts to those\\nThat weigh their pains in sense and do suppose\\nWhat hath been cannot be: who ever strove\\nSo show her merit, that did miss her love?\\nThe king's disease--my project may deceive me,\\nBut my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.\\nExit\\n\\nSCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.\\n\\nFlourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants\\n\\nKING\\n\\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;\\nHave fought with equal fortune and continue\\nA braving war.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\n                  So 'tis reported, sir.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nNay, 'tis most credible; we here received it\\nA certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,\\nWith caution that the Florentine will move us\\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\\nPrejudicates the business and would seem\\nTo have us make denial.\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nHis love and wisdom,\\nApproved so to your majesty, may plead\\nFor amplest credence.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nHe hath arm'd our answer,\\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\\nTo stand on either part.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nIt well may serve\\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\\nFor breathing and exploit.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nWhat's he comes here?\\nEnter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES\\n\\nFirst Lord\\n\\nIt is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,\\nYoung Bertram.\\n\\nKING\\n\\n                  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;\\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\\nHath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts\\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty's.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\\nFirst tried our soldiership! He did look far\\nInto the service of the time and was\\nDiscipled of the bravest: he lasted long;\\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on\\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\\nTo talk of your good father. In his youth\\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\\nTo-day in our young lords; but they may jest\\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\\nEre they can hide their levity in honour;\\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\\nHis equal had awaked them, and his honour,\\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\\nException bid him speak, and at this time\\nHis tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him\\nHe used as creatures of another place\\nAnd bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,\\nMaking them proud of his humility,\\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\\nWhich, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now\\nBut goers backward.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nHis good remembrance, sir,\\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\\nAs in your royal speech.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nWould I were with him! He would always say--\\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\\nHe scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,\\nTo grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--\\nThis his good melancholy oft began,\\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\\nWhen it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,\\n'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\\nExpire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;\\nI after him do after him wish too,\\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive,\\nTo give some labourers room.\\n\\nSecond Lord\\n\\nYou are loved, sir:\\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nI fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,\\nSince the physician at your father's died?\\nHe was much famed.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\n                  Some six months since, my lord.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nIf he were living, I would try him yet.\\nLend me an arm; the rest have worn me out\\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;\\nMy son's no dearer.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nThank your majesty.\\nExeunt. Flourish\\n\\nSCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.\\n\\nEnter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nI will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?\\n\\nSteward\\n\\nMadam, the care I have had to even your content, I\\nwish might be found in the calendar of my past\\nendeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make\\nfoul the clearness of our deservings, when of\\nourselves we publish them.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:\\nthe complaints I have heard of you I do not all\\nbelieve: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know\\nyou lack not folly to commit them, and have ability\\nenough to make such knaveries yours.\\n\\nClown\\n\\n'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWell, sir.\\n\\nClown\\n\\nNo, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though\\nmany of the rich are damned: but, if I may have\\nyour ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel\\nthe woman and I will do as we may.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\\n\\nClown\\n\\nI do beg your good will in this case.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nIn what case?\\n\\nClown\\n\\nIn Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no\\nheritage: and I think I shall never have the\\nblessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for\\nthey say barnes are blessings.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\\n\\nClown\\n\\nMy poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on\\nby the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nIs this all your worship's reason?\\n\\nClown\\n\\nFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they\\nare.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nMay the world know them?\\n\\nClown\\n\\nI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and\\nall flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry\\nthat I may repent.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\\n\\nClown\\n\\nI am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have\\nfriends for my wife's sake.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.\\n\\nClown\\n\\nYou're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the\\nknaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.\\nHe that ears my land spares my team and gives me\\nleave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my\\ndrudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher\\nof my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh\\nand blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my\\nflesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses\\nmy wife is my friend. If men could be contented to\\nbe what they are, there were no fear in marriage;\\nfor young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the\\nPapist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in\\nreligion, their heads are both one; they may jowl\\nhorns together, like any deer i' the herd.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?\\n\\nClown\\n\\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next\\nway:\\nFor I the ballad will repeat,\\nWhich men full true shall find;\\nYour marriage comes by destiny,\\nYour cuckoo sings by kind.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nGet you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.\\n\\nSteward\\n\\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to\\nyou: of her I am to speak.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;\\nHelen, I mean.\\n\\nClown\\n\\n     Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\\nWhy the Grecians sacked Troy?\\nFond done, done fond,\\nWas this King Priam's joy?\\nWith that she sighed as she stood,\\nWith that she sighed as she stood,\\nAnd gave this sentence then;\\nAmong nine bad if one be good,\\nAmong nine bad if one be good,\\nThere's yet one good in ten.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWhat, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.\\n\\nClown\\n\\nOne good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying\\no' the song: would God would serve the world so all\\nthe year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,\\nif I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we\\nmight have a good woman born but one every blazing\\nstar, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery\\nwell: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck\\none.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nYou'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.\\n\\nClown\\n\\nThat man should be at woman's command, and yet no\\nhurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it\\nwill do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of\\nhumility over the black gown of a big heart. I am\\ngoing, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.\\nExit\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nWell, now.\\n\\nSteward\\n\\nI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nFaith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and\\nshe herself, without other advantage, may lawfully\\nmake title to as much love as she finds: there is\\nmore owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid\\nher than she'll demand.\\n\\nSteward\\n\\nMadam, I was very late more near her than I think\\nshe wished me: alone she was, and did communicate\\nto herself her own words to her own ears; she\\nthought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any\\nstranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:\\nFortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put\\nsuch difference betwixt their two estates; Love no\\ngod, that would not extend his might, only where\\nqualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that\\nwould suffer her poor knight surprised, without\\nrescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.\\nThis she delivered in the most bitter touch of\\nsorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I\\nheld my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\\nsithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns\\nyou something to know it.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nYou have discharged this honestly; keep it to\\nyourself: many likelihoods informed me of this\\nbefore, which hung so tottering in the balance that\\nI could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,\\nleave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you\\nfor your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.\\nExit Steward\\nEnter HELENA\\nEven so it was with me when I was young:\\nIf ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn\\nDoth to our rose of youth rightly belong;\\nOur blood to us, this to our blood is born;\\nIt is the show and seal of nature's truth,\\nWhere love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:\\nBy our remembrances of days foregone,\\nSuch were our faults, or then we thought them none.\\nHer eye is sick on't: I observe her now.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nWhat is your pleasure, madam?\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nYou know, Helen,\\nI am a mother to you.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nMine honourable mistress.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nNay, a mother:\\nWhy not a mother?

Good alone\\nIs good without a name. Vileness is so:\\nThe property by what it is should go,\\nNot by the title. She is young, wise, fair;\\nIn these to nature she's immediate heir,\\nAnd these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,\\nWhich challenges itself as honour's born\\nAnd is not like the sire: honours thrive,\\nWhen rather from our acts we them derive\\nThan our foregoers: the mere word's a slave\\nDebosh'd on every tomb, on every grave\\nA lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\\nWhere dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb\\nOf honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?\\nIf thou canst like this creature as a maid,\\nI can create the rest: virtue and she\\nIs her own dower; honour and wealth from me.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nI cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nThou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.\\n\\nHELENA\\n\\nThat you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:\\nLet the rest go.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nMy honour's at the stake; which to defeat,\\nI must produce my power. Here, take her hand,\\nProud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;\\nThat dost in vile misprision shackle up\\nMy love and her desert; that canst not dream,\\nWe, poising us in her defective scale,\\nShall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,\\nIt is in us to plant thine honour where\\nWe please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:\\nObey our will, which travails in thy good:\\nBelieve not thy disdain, but presently\\nDo thine own fortunes that obedient right\\nWhich both thy duty owes and our power claims;\\nOr I will throw thee from my care for ever\\nInto the staggers and the careless lapse\\nOf youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\\nLoosing upon thee, in the name of justice,\\nWithout all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nPardon, my gracious lord; for I submit\\nMy fancy to your eyes: when I consider\\nWhat great creation and what dole of honour\\nFlies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\\nWas in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\\nThe praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\\nIs as 'twere born so.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nTake her by the hand,\\nAnd tell her she is thine: to whom I promise\\nA counterpoise, if not to thy estate\\nA balance more replete.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nI take her hand.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nGood fortune and the favour of the king\\nSmile upon this contract; whose ceremony\\nShall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\\nAnd be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast\\nShall more attend upon the coming space,\\nExpecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,\\nThy love's to me religious; else, does err.\\nExeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\n[Advancing]  Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nYour pleasure, sir?\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nYour lord and master did well to make his\\nrecantation.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nRecantation!

I\\nhave now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care\\nnot: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and\\nthat thou't scarce worth.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nHadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nDo not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou\\nhasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee\\nfor a hen!

I have a desire to hold\\nmy acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,\\nthat I may say in the default, he is a man I know.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nMy lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nI would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor\\ndoing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by\\nthee, in what motion age will give me leave.\\nExit\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nWell, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off\\nme; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must\\nbe patient; there is no fettering of authority.\\nI'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with\\nany convenience, an he were double and double a\\nlord.

God?\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nAy, sir.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nThe devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou\\ngarter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of\\nsleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set\\nthy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine\\nhonour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat\\nthee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and\\nevery man should beat thee: I think thou wast\\ncreated for men to breathe themselves upon thee.\\n\\nPAROLLES\\n\\nThis is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nGo to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a\\nkernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and\\nno true traveller: you are more saucy with lords\\nand honourable personages than the commission of your\\nbirth and virtue gives you heraldry.

Well, Diana, take heed of this\\nFrench earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and\\nno legacy is so rich as honesty.\\n\\nWidow\\n\\nI have told my neighbour how you have been solicited\\nby a gentleman his companion.\\n\\nMARIANA\\n\\nI know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a\\nfilthy officer he is in those suggestions for the\\nyoung earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,\\nenticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of\\nlust, are not the things they go under: many a maid\\nhath been seduced by them; and the misery is,\\nexample, that so terrible shows in the wreck of\\nmaidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,\\nbut that they are limed with the twigs that threaten\\nthem.

Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants\\n\\nKING\\n\\nWe lost a jewel of her; and our esteem\\nWas made much poorer by it: but your son,\\nAs mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know\\nHer estimation home.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\n'Tis past, my liege;\\nAnd I beseech your majesty to make it\\nNatural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;\\nWhen oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,\\nO'erbears it and burns on.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nMy honour'd lady,\\nI have forgiven and forgotten all;\\nThough my revenges were high bent upon him,\\nAnd watch'd the time to shoot.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nThis I must say,\\nBut first I beg my pardon, the young lord\\nDid to his majesty, his mother and his lady\\nOffence of mighty note; but to himself\\nThe greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife\\nWhose beauty did astonish the survey\\nOf richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,\\nWhose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve\\nHumbly call'd mistress.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nPraising what is lost\\nMakes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;\\nWe are reconciled, and the first view shall kill\\nAll repetition: let him not ask our pardon;\\nThe nature of his great offence is dead,\\nAnd deeper than oblivion we do bury\\nThe incensing relics of it: let him approach,\\nA stranger, no offender; and inform him\\nSo 'tis our will he should.\\n\\nGentleman\\n\\nI shall, my liege.\\nExit\\n\\nKING\\n\\nWhat says he to your daughter? have you spoke?\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nAll that he is hath reference to your highness.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nThen shall we have a match.

You remember\\nThe daughter of this lord?\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nAdmiringly, my liege, at first\\nI stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart\\nDurst make too bold a herald of my tongue\\nWhere the impression of mine eye infixing,\\nContempt his scornful perspective did lend me,\\nWhich warp'd the line of every other favour;\\nScorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;\\nExtended or contracted all proportions\\nTo a most hideous object: thence it came\\nThat she whom all men praised and whom myself,\\nSince I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye\\nThe dust that did offend it.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nWell excused:\\nThat thou didst love her, strikes some scores away\\nFrom the great compt: but love that comes too late,\\nLike a remorseful pardon slowly carried,\\nTo the great sender turns a sour offence,\\nCrying, 'That's good that's gone.'

Had you that craft, to reave\\nher\\nOf what should stead her most?\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nMy gracious sovereign,\\nHowe'er it pleases you to take it so,\\nThe ring was never hers.\\n\\nCOUNTESS\\n\\nSon, on my life,\\nI have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it\\nAt her life's rate.\\n\\nLAFEU\\n\\nI am sure I saw her wear it.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nYou are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:\\nIn Florence was it from a casement thrown me,\\nWrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name\\nOf her that threw it: noble she was, and thought\\nI stood engaged: but when I had subscribed\\nTo mine own fortune and inform'd her fully\\nI could not answer in that course of honour\\nAs she had made the overture, she ceased\\nIn heavy satisfaction and would never\\nReceive the ring again.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nPlutus himself,\\nThat knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,\\nHath not in nature's mystery more science\\nThan I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,\\nWhoever gave it you. Then, if you know\\nThat you are well acquainted with yourself,\\nConfess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\\nYou got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety\\nThat she would never put it from her finger,\\nUnless she gave it to yourself in bed,\\nWhere you have never come, or sent it us\\nUpon her great disaster.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nShe never saw it.\\n\\nKING\\n\\nThou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;\\nAnd makest conjectural fears to come into me\\nWhich I would fain shut out. If it should prove\\nThat thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--\\nAnd yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,\\nAnd she is dead; which nothing, but to close\\nHer eyes myself, could win me to believe,\\nMore than to see this ring. Take him away.\\nGuards seize BERTRAM\\nMy fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,\\nShall tax my fears of little vanity,\\nHaving vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!\\nWe'll sift this matter further.\\n\\nBERTRAM\\n\\nIf you shall prove\\nThis ring was ever hers, you shall as easy\\nProve that I husbanded her bed in Florence,\\nWhere yet she never was.\\nExit, guarded\\n\\nKING\\n\\nI am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.\\nEnter a Gentleman\\n\\nGentleman\\n\\nGracious sovereign,\\nWhether I have been to blame or no, I know not:\\nHere's a petition from a Florentine,\\nWho hath for four or five removes come short\\nTo tender it herself.

 lafeu  he hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.  countess  this young gentlewoman had a father,--o, that 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. would, for the king's sake, he were living! i think it would be the death of the king's disease.  lafeu  how called you the man you speak of, madam?  countess  he was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: gerard de narbon.  lafeu  he was excellent indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.  bertram  what is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?  lafeu  a fistula, my lord.  bertram  i heard not of it before.  lafeu  i would it were not notorious. was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon?  countess  his sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. i have those hopes of her good that her education promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.  lafeu  your commendations, madam, get from her tears.  countess  'tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. no more of this, helena; go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it.  helena  i do affect a sorrow indeed, but i have it too.  lafeu  moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.  countess  if the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.  bertram  madam, i desire your holy wishes.  lafeu  how understand we that?  countess  be thou blest, bertram, and succeed thy father in manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness share with thy birthright! love all, trust a few, do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy rather in power than use, and keep thy friend under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence, but never tax'd for speech. what heaven more will, that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, fall on thy head! farewell, my lord; 'tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, advise him.  lafeu            he cannot want the best that shall attend his love.  countess  heaven bless him! farewell, bertram. exit  bertram  [to helena]  the best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you! be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.  lafeu  farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father. exeunt bertram and lafeu  helena  o, were that all! i think not on my father; and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him. what was he like? i have forgot him: my imagination carries no favour in't but bertram's. i am undone: there is no living, none, if bertram be away. 'twere all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it, he is so above me: in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted, not in his sphere. the ambition in my love thus plagues itself: the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love. 'twas pretty, though plague, to see him every hour; to sit and draw his arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, in our heart's table; heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour: but now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques. who comes here? enter parolles aside one that goes with him: i love him for his sake; and yet i know him a notorious liar, think him a great way fool, solely a coward; yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him, that they take place, when virtue's steely bones look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.  parolles  save you, fair queen!  helena  and you, monarch!  parolles  no.  helena  and no.  parolles  are you meditating on virginity?  helena  ay. you have some stain of soldier in you: let me ask you a question. man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?  parolles  keep him out.  helena  but he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some warlike resistance.  parolles  there is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.  helena  bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men?  parolles  virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. that you were made of is metal to make virgins. virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!  helena  i will stand for 't a little, though therefore i die a virgin.  parolles  there's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature. to speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. he that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!  helena  how might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?  parolles  let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes.

i say, i am your mother; and put you in the catalogue of those that were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen adoption strives with nature and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds: you ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan, yet i express to you a mother's care: god's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood to say i am thy mother?

 helena                    madam, i had.  countess  wherefore? tell true.  helena  i will tell truth; by grace itself i swear. you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and proved effects, such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty; and that he will'd me in heedfull'st reservation to bestow them, as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note: amongst the rest, there is a remedy, approved, set down, to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is render'd lost.  countess  this was your motive for paris, was it?

if thou canst like this creature as a maid, i can create the rest: virtue and she is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.  bertram  i cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.  king  thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.  helena  that you are well restored, my lord, i'm glad: let the rest go.  king  my honour's at the stake; which to defeat, i must produce my power. here, take her hand, proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift; that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert; that canst not dream, we, poising us in her defective scale, shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know, it is in us to plant thine honour where we please to have it grow. cheque thy contempt: obey our will, which travails in thy good: believe not thy disdain, but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims; or i will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee, in the name of justice, without all terms of pity. speak; thine answer.  bertram  pardon, my gracious lord; for i submit my fancy to your eyes: when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it, i find that she, which late was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now the praised of the king; who, so ennobled, is as 'twere born so.  king  take her by the hand, and tell her she is thine: to whom i promise a counterpoise, if not to thy estate a balance more replete.  bertram  i take her hand.  king  good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract; whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the now-born brief, and be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space, expecting absent friends. as thou lovest her, thy love's to me religious; else, does err. exeunt all but lafeu and parolles  lafeu  [advancing]  do you hear, monsieur?

might you not know she would do as she has done, by sending me a letter? read it again.  steward  [reads] i am saint jaques' pilgrim, thither gone: ambitious love hath so in me offended, that barefoot plod i the cold ground upon, with sainted vow my faults to have amended. write, write, that from the bloody course of war my dearest master, your dear son, may hie: bless him at home in peace, whilst i from far his name with zealous fervor sanctify: his taken labours bid him me forgive; i, his despiteful juno, sent him forth from courtly friends, with camping foes to live, where death and danger dogs the heels of worth: he is too good and fair for death and me: whom i myself embrace, to set him free.  countess  ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words! rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much, as letting her pass so: had i spoke with her, i could have well diverted her intents, which thus she hath prevented.  steward  pardon me, madam: if i had given you this at over-night, she might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes, pursuit would be but vain.  countess  what angel shall bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive, unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice. write, write, rinaldo, to this unworthy husband of his wife; let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light: my greatest grief. though little he do feel it, set down sharply. dispatch the most convenient messenger: when haply he shall hear that she is gone, he will return; and hope i may that she, hearing so much, will speed her foot again, led hither by pure love: which of them both is dearest to me. i have no skill in sense to make distinction: provide this messenger: my heart is heavy and mine age is weak; grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak. exeunt  scene v. florence. without the walls. a tucket afar off.  enter an old widow of florence, diana, violenta, and mariana, with other citizens  widow  nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we shall lose all the sight.  diana  they say the french count has done most honourable service.  widow  it is reported that he has taken their greatest commander; and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother. tucket we have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.  mariana  come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it. well, diana, take heed of this french earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and no legacy is so rich as honesty.  widow  i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.  mariana  i know that knave; hang him! one parolles: a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. beware of them, diana; their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them. i hope i need not to advise you further; but i hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.  diana  you shall not need to fear me.  widow  i hope so. enter helena, disguised like a pilgrim look, here comes a pilgrim: i know she will lie at my house; thither they send one another: i'll question her. god save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?  helena  to saint jaques le grand. where do the palmers lodge, i do beseech you?  widow  at the saint francis here beside the port.  helena  is this the way?  widow  ay, marry, is't. a march afar hark you! they come this way. if you will tarry, holy pilgrim, but till the troops come by, i will conduct you where you shall be lodged; the rather, for i think i know your hostess as ample as myself.  helena  is it yourself?  widow  if you shall please so, pilgrim.  helena  i thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.  widow  you came, i think, from france?  helena  i did so.  widow  here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service.  helena  his name, i pray you.  diana  the count rousillon: know you such a one?  helena  but by the ear, that hears most nobly of him: his face i know not.  diana  whatsome'er he is, he's bravely taken here. he stole from france, as 'tis reported, for the king had married him against his liking: think you it is so?  helena  ay, surely, mere the truth: i know his lady.  diana  there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her.  helena  what's his name?  diana  monsieur parolles.  helena                    o, i believe with him, in argument of praise, or to the worth of the great count himself, she is too mean to have her name repeated: all her deserving is a reserved honesty, and that i have not heard examined.  diana  alas, poor lady! 'tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord.  widow  i warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is, her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her a shrewd turn, if she pleased.  helena  how do you mean? may be the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose.  widow  he does indeed; and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid: but she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence.  mariana  the gods forbid else!  widow  so, now they come: drum and colours enter bertram, parolles, and the whole army that is antonio, the duke's eldest son; that, escalus.  helena                    which is the frenchman?  diana  he; that with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow. i would he loved his wife: if he were honester he were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?  helena  i like him well.  diana  'tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave that leads him to these places: were i his lady, i would poison that vile rascal.  helena  which is he?  diana  that jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?  helena  perchance he's hurt i' the battle.  parolles  lose our drum! well.  mariana  he's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.  widow  marry, hang you!  mariana  and your courtesy, for a ring-carrier! exeunt bertram, parolles, and army  widow  the troop is past. come, pilgrim, i will bring you where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents there's four or five, to great saint jaques bound, already at my house.  helena  i humbly thank you: please it this matron and this gentle maid to eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking shall be for me; and, to requite you further, i will bestow some precepts of this virgin worthy the note.  both                    we'll take your offer kindly. exeunt  scene vi. camp before florence.  enter bertram and the two french lords  second lord  nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.  first lord  if your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect.  second lord  on my life, my lord, a bubble.  bertram  do you think i am so far deceived in him?  second lord  believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment.  first lord  it were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.  bertram  i would i knew in what particular action to try him.  first lord  none better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.  second lord  i, with a troop of florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such i will have, whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. be but your lordship present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing.  first lord  o, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for't: when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not john drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. here he comes. enter parolles  second lord  [aside to bertram]  o, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand.  bertram  how now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition.  first lord  a pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.  parolles  'but a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? a drum so lost! there was excellent command,--to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!  first lord  that was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.  bertram  well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recovered.  parolles  it might have been recovered.  bertram  it might; but it is not now.  parolles  it is to be recovered: but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, i would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'  bertram  why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it. and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.  parolles  by the hand of a soldier, i will undertake it.  bertram  but you must not now slumber in it.  parolles  i'll about it this evening: and i will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.  bertram  may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?  parolles  i know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt i vow.  bertram  i know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. farewell.  parolles  i love not many words. exit  second lord  no more than a fish loves water. is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to do't?  first lord  you do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out, you have him ever after.  bertram  why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?  second lord  none in the world; but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.  first lord  we'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night.  second lord  i must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.  bertram  your brother he shall go along with me.  second lord  as't please your lordship: i'll leave you. exit  bertram  now will i lead you to the house, and show you the lass i spoke of.  first lord  but you say she's honest.  bertram  that's all the fault: i spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold; but i sent to her, by this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind, tokens and letters which she did re-send; and this is all i have done. she's a fair creature: will you go see her?  first lord  with all my heart, my lord. exeunt  scene vii. florence. the widow's house.  enter helena and widow  helena  if you misdoubt me that i am not she, i know not how i shall assure you further, but i shall lose the grounds i work upon.  widow  though my estate be fallen, i was well born, nothing acquainted with these businesses; and would not put my reputation now in any staining act.  helena  nor would i wish you. first, give me trust, the count he is my husband, and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken is so from word to word; and then you cannot, by the good aid that i of you shall borrow, err in bestowing it.  widow  i should believe you: for you have show'd me that which well approves you're great in fortune.  helena  take this purse of gold, and let me buy your friendly help thus far, which i will over-pay and pay again when i have found it. the count he wooes your daughter, lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent, as we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it. now his important blood will nought deny that she'll demand: a ring the county wears, that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son, some four or five descents since the first father wore it: this ring he holds in most rich choice; yet in his idle fire, to buy his will, it would not seem too dear, howe'er repented after.  widow  now i see the bottom of your purpose.  helena  you see it lawful, then: it is no more, but that your daughter, ere she seems as won, desires this ring; appoints him an encounter; in fine, delivers me to fill the time, herself most chastely absent: after this, to marry her, i'll add three thousand crowns to what is passed already.  widow  i have yielded: instruct my daughter how she shall persever, that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent. every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs composed to her unworthiness: it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves; for he persists as if his life lay on't.  helena  why then to-night let us assay our plot; which, if it speed, is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act, where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact: but let's about it. exeunt  act iv scene i. without the florentine camp.  enter second french lord, with five or six other soldiers in ambush  second lord  he can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. when you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will: though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter.  first soldier  good captain, let me be the interpreter.  second lord  art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?  first soldier  no, sir, i warrant you.  second lord  but what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?  first soldier  e'en such as you speak to me.  second lord  he must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment. now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language, gabble enough, and good enough. as for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. but couch, ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. enter parolles  parolles  ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. what shall i say i have done? it must be a very plausive invention that carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door. i find my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of mars before it and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.  second lord  this is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of.  parolles  what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing i had no such purpose? i must give myself some hurts, and say i got them in exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they will say, 'came you off with so little?' and great ones i dare not give. wherefore, what's the instance? tongue, i must put you into a butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.  second lord  is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?  parolles  i would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my spanish sword.  second lord  we cannot afford you so.  parolles  or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in stratagem.  second lord  'twould not do.  parolles  or to drown my clothes, and say i was stripped.  second lord  hardly serve.  parolles  though i swore i leaped from the window of the citadel.  second lord  how deep?  parolles  thirty fathom.  second lord  three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.  parolles  i would i had any drum of the enemy's: i would swear i recovered it.  second lord  you shall hear one anon.  parolles  a drum now of the enemy's,-- alarum within  second lord  throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.  all  cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.  parolles  o, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes. they seize and blindfold him  first soldier  boskos thromuldo boskos.  parolles  i know you are the muskos' regiment: and i shall lose my life for want of language; if there be here german, or dane, low dutch, italian, or french, let him speak to me; i'll discover that which shall undo the florentine.  first soldier  boskos vauvado: i understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.  parolles  o!  first soldier  o, pray, pray, pray! manka revania dulche.  second lord  oscorbidulchos volivorco.  first soldier  the general is content to spare thee yet; and, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on to gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform something to save thy life.  parolles  o, let me live! and all the secrets of our camp i'll show, their force, their purposes; nay, i'll speak that which you will wonder at.  first soldier  but wilt thou faithfully?

if quick fire of youth light not your mind, you are no maiden, but a monument: when you are dead, you should be such a one as you are now, for you are cold and stem; and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got.  diana  she then was honest.  bertram  so should you be.  diana  no: my mother did but duty; such, my lord, as you owe to your wife.  bertram  no more o' that; i prithee, do not strive against my vows: i was compell'd to her; but i love thee by love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever do thee all rights of service.  diana  ay, so you serve us till we serve you; but when you have our roses, you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness.  bertram  how have i sworn!  diana  'tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, but the plain single vow that is vow'd true. what is not holy, that we swear not by, but take the high'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me, if i should swear by god's great attributes, i loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, when i did love you ill? this has no holding, to swear by him whom i protest to love, that i will work against him: therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd, at least in my opinion.  bertram  change it, change it; be not so holy-cruel: love is holy; and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts that you do charge men with. stand no more off, but give thyself unto my sick desires, who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever my love as it begins shall so persever.  diana  i see that men make ropes in such a scarre that we'll forsake ourselves. give me that ring.  bertram  i'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power to give it from me.  diana  will you not, my lord?  bertram  it is an honour 'longing to our house, bequeathed down from many ancestors; which were the greatest obloquy i' the world in me to lose.  diana                    mine honour's such a ring: my chastity's the jewel of our house, bequeathed down from many ancestors; which were the greatest obloquy i' the world in me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part, against your vain assault.  bertram  here, take my ring: my house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine, and i'll be bid by thee.  diana  when midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window: i'll order take my mother shall not hear. now will i charge you in the band of truth, when you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed, remain there but an hour, nor speak to me: my reasons are most strong; and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliver'd: and on your finger in the night i'll put another ring, that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds. adieu, till then; then, fail not. you have won a wife of me, though there my hope be done.  bertram  a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee. exit  diana  for which live long to thank both heaven and me! you may so in the end. my mother told me just how he would woo, as if she sat in 's heart; she says all men have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me when his wife's dead; therefore i'll lie with him when i am buried. since frenchmen are so braid, marry that will, i live and die a maid: only in this disguise i think't no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win. exit  scene iii. the florentine camp.  enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers  first lord  you have not given him his mother's letter?  second lord  i have delivered it an hour since: there is something in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he changed almost into another man.  first lord  he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.  second lord  especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. i will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.  first lord  when you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and i am the grave of it.  second lord  he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.  first lord  now, god delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, what things are we!  second lord  merely our own traitors. and as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.  first lord  is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? we shall not then have his company to-night?  second lord  not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.  first lord  that approaches apace; i would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.  second lord  we will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other.  first lord  in the mean time, what hear you of these wars?  second lord  i hear there is an overture of peace.  first lord  nay, i assure you, a peace concluded.  second lord  what will count rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again into france?  first lord  i perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.  second lord  let it be forbid, sir; so should i be a great deal of his act.  first lord  sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.  second lord  how is this justified?  first lord  the stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place.  second lord  hath the count all this intelligence?  first lord  ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, so to the full arming of the verity.  second lord  i am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.  first lord  how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!  second lord  and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.  first lord  the web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues. enter a messenger how now! where's your master?  servant  he met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for france. the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king.  second lord  they shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.  first lord  they cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness. here's his lordship now. enter bertram how now, my lord! is't not after midnight?  bertram  i have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success: i have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my lady mother i am returning; entertained my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but that i have not ended yet.  second lord  if the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.  bertram  i mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? come, bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier.  second lord  bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.  bertram  no matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. how does he carry himself?  second lord  i have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. but to answer you as you would be understood; he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?  bertram  nothing of me, has a'?  second lord  his confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face: if your lordship be in't, as i believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it. enter parolles guarded, and first soldier  bertram  a plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me: hush, hush!  first lord  hoodman comes! portotartarosa  first soldier  he calls for the tortures: what will you say without 'em?  parolles  i will confess what i know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, i can say no more.  first soldier  bosko chimurcho.  first lord  boblibindo chicurmurco.  first soldier  you are a merciful general. our general bids you answer to what i shall ask you out of a note.  parolles  and truly, as i hope to live.  first soldier  [reads]  'first demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.' what say you to that?  parolles  five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit and as i hope to live.  first soldier  shall i set down your answer so?  parolles  do: i'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.  bertram  all's one to him. what a past-saving slave is this!  first lord  you're deceived, my lord: this is monsieur parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of his dagger.  second lord  i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly.  first soldier  well, that's set down.  parolles  five or six thousand horse, i said,-- i will say true,--or thereabouts, set down, for i'll speak truth.  first lord  he's very near the truth in this.  bertram  but i con him no thanks for't, in the nature he delivers it.  parolles  poor rogues, i pray you, say.  first soldier  well, that's set down.  parolles  i humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor.  first soldier  [reads]  'demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot.' what say you to that?  parolles  by my troth, sir, if i were to live this present hour, i will tell true. let me see: spurio, a hundred and fifty; sebastian, so many; corambus, so many; jaques, so many; guiltian, cosmo, lodowick, and gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own company, chitopher, vaumond, bentii, two hundred and fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.  bertram  what shall be done to him?  first lord  nothing, but let him have thanks. demand of him my condition, and what credit i have with the duke.  first soldier  well, that's set down. reads 'you shall demand of him, whether one captain dumain be i' the camp, a frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to revolt.' what say you to this? what do you know of it?  parolles  i beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories: demand them singly.  first soldier  do you know this captain dumain?  parolles  i know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay.  bertram  nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.  first soldier  well, is this captain in the duke of florence's camp?  parolles  upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.  first lord  nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.  first soldier  what is his reputation with the duke?  parolles  the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band: i think i have his letter in my pocket.  first soldier  marry, we'll search.  parolles  in good sadness, i do not know; either it is there, or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent.  first soldier  here 'tis; here's a paper: shall i read it to you?  parolles  i do not know if it be it or no.  bertram  our interpreter does it well.  first lord  excellently.  first soldier  [reads]  'dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--  parolles  that is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence, one diana, to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish: i pray you, sir, put it up again.  first soldier  nay, i'll read it first, by your favour.  parolles  my meaning in't, i protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.  bertram  damnable both-sides rogue!  first soldier  [reads]  'when he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it; after he scores, he never pays the score: half won is match well made; match, and well make it; he ne'er pays after-debts, take it before; and say a soldier, dian, told thee this, men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss: for count of this, the count's a fool, i know it, who pays before, but not when he does owe it. thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear, parolles.'  bertram  he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in's forehead.  second lord  this is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.  bertram  i could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me.  first soldier  i perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be fain to hang you.  parolles  my life, sir, in any case: not that i am afraid to die; but that, my offences being many, i would repent out the remainder of nature: let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so i may live.  first soldier  we'll see what may be done, so you confess freely; therefore, once more to this captain dumain: you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is his honesty?  parolles  he will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus: he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than hercules: he will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. i have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has every thing that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing.  first lord  i begin to love him for this.  bertram  for this description of thine honesty? a pox upon him for me, he's more and more a cat.  first soldier  what say you to his expertness in war?  parolles  faith, sir, he has led the drum before the english tragedians; to belie him, i will not, and more of his soldiership i know not; except, in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: i would do the man what honour i can, but of this i am not certain.  first lord  he hath out-villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him.  bertram  a pox on him, he's a cat still.  first soldier  his qualities being at this poor price, i need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.  parolles  sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.  first soldier  what's his brother, the other captain dumain?  second lord  why does be ask him of me?  first soldier  what's he?  parolles  e'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is: in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.  first soldier  if your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the florentine?  parolles  ay, and the captain of his horse, count rousillon.  first soldier  i'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.  parolles  [aside]  i'll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have i run into this danger. yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken?  first soldier  there is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the general says, you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. come, headsman, off with his head.  parolles  o lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!  first lord  that shall you, and take your leave of all your friends. unblinding him so, look about you: know you any here?  bertram  good morrow, noble captain.  second lord  god bless you, captain parolles.  first lord  god save you, noble captain.  second lord  captain, what greeting will you to my lord lafeu? i am for france.  first lord  good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to diana in behalf of the count rousillon? an i were not a very coward, i'ld compel it of you: but fare you well. exeunt bertram and lords  first soldier  you are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that has a knot on't yet  parolles  who cannot be crushed with a plot?  first soldier  if you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. fare ye well, sir; i am for france too: we shall speak of you there. exit with soldiers  parolles  yet am i thankful: if my heart were great, 'twould burst at this. captain i'll be no more; but i will eat and drink, and sleep as soft as captain shall: simply the thing i am shall make me live. who knows himself a braggart, let him fear this, for it will come to pass that every braggart shall be found an ass. rust, sword?

have you spoke?  lafeu  all that he is hath reference to your highness.  king  then shall we have a match. i have letters sent me that set him high in fame. enter bertram  lafeu  he looks well on't.  king  i am not a day of season, for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once: but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth; the time is fair again.  bertram  my high-repented blames, dear sovereign, pardon to me.  king  all is whole; not one word more of the consumed time. let's take the instant by the forward top; for we are old, and on our quick'st decrees the inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them. you remember the daughter of this lord?  bertram  admiringly, my liege, at first i stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing, contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, which warp'd the line of every other favour; scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen; extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object: thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself, since i have lost, have loved, was in mine eye the dust that did offend it.  king  well excused: that thou didst love her, strikes some scores away from the great compt: but love that comes too late, like a remorseful pardon slowly carried, to the great sender turns a sour offence, crying, 'that's good that's gone.' our rash faults make trivial price of serious things we have, not knowing them until we know their grave: oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, destroy our friends and after weep their dust our own love waking cries to see what's done, while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon. be this sweet helen's knell, and now forget her. send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin: the main consents are had; and here we'll stay to see our widower's second marriage-day.  countess  which better than the first, o dear heaven, bless! or, ere they meet, in me, o nature, cesse!  lafeu  come on, my son, in whom my house's name must be digested, give a favour from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, that she may quickly come. bertram gives a ring by my old beard, and every hair that's on't, helen, that's dead, was a sweet creature: such a ring as this, the last that e'er i took her at court, i saw upon her finger.  bertram  hers it was not.  king  now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye, while i was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't. this ring was mine; and, when i gave it helen, i bade her, if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help, that by this token i would relieve her. had you that craft, to reave her of what should stead her most?  bertram  my gracious sovereign, howe'er it pleases you to take it so, the ring was never hers.  countess  son, on my life, i have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it at her life's rate.  lafeu  i am sure i saw her wear it.  bertram  you are deceived, my lord; she never saw it: in florence was it from a casement thrown me, wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought i stood engaged: but when i had subscribed to mine own fortune and inform'd her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture, she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again.  king  plutus himself, that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, hath not in nature's mystery more science than i have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas helen's, whoever gave it you. then, if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself, confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement you got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger, unless she gave it to yourself in bed, where you have never come, or sent it us upon her great disaster.  bertram  she never saw it.  king  thou speak'st it falsely, as i love mine honour; and makest conjectural fears to come into me which i would fain shut out. if it should prove that thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;-- and yet i know not: thou didst hate her deadly, and she is dead; which nothing, but to close her eyes myself, could win me to believe, more than to see this ring. take him away. guards seize bertram my fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall, shall tax my fears of little vanity, having vainly fear'd too little. away with him! we'll sift this matter further.  bertram  if you shall prove this ring was ever hers, you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence, where yet she never was. exit, guarded  king  i am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings. enter a gentleman  gentleman  gracious sovereign, whether i have been to blame or no, i know not: here's a petition from a florentine, who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself. i undertook it, vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant, who by this i know is here attending: her business looks in her with an importing visage; and she told me, in a sweet verbal brief, it did concern your highness with herself.  king  [reads]  upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, i blush to say it, he won me. now is the count rousillon a widower: his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. he stole from florence, taking no leave, and i follow him to his country for justice: grant it me, o king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. diana capilet.  lafeu  i will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this: i'll none of him.  king  the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu, to bring forth this discovery. seek these suitors: go speedily and bring again the count. i am afeard the life of helen, lady, was foully snatch'd.  countess  now, justice on the doers! re-enter bertram, guarded  king  i wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you, and that you fly them as you swear them lordship, yet you desire to marry. enter widow and diana what woman's that?  diana  i am, my lord, a wretched florentine, derived from the ancient capilet: my suit, as i do understand, you know, and therefore know how far i may be pitied.  widow  i am her mother, sir, whose age and honour both suffer under this complaint we bring, and both shall cease, without your remedy.  king  come hither, count; do you know these women?  bertram  my lord, i neither can nor will deny but that i know them: do they charge me further?  diana  why do you look so strange upon your wife?  bertram  she's none of mine, my lord.  diana  if you shall marry, you give away this hand, and that is mine; you give away heaven's vows, and those are mine; you give away myself, which is known mine; for i by vow am so embodied yours, that she which marries you must marry me, either both or none.  lafeu  your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.  bertram  my lord, this is a fond and desperate creature, whom sometime i have laugh'd with: let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here.  king  sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies.  diana  good my lord, ask him upon his oath, if he does think he had not my virginity.  king  what say'st thou to her?  bertram  she's impudent, my lord, and was a common gamester to the camp.  diana  he does me wrong, my lord; if i were so, he might have bought me at a common price: do not believe him. o, behold this ring, whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel; yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o' the camp, if i be one.  countess                    he blushes, and 'tis it: of six preceding ancestors, that gem, conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue, hath it been owed and worn. this is his wife; that ring's a thousand proofs.  king  methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it.  diana  i did, my lord, but loath am to produce so bad an instrument: his name's parolles.  lafeu  i saw the man to-day, if man he be.  king  find him, and bring him hither. exit an attendant  bertram  what of him?

 king  she hath that ring of yours.  bertram  i think she has: certain it is i liked her, and boarded her i' the wanton way of youth: she knew her distance and did angle for me, madding my eagerness with her restraint, as all impediments in fancy's course are motives of more fancy; and, in fine, her infinite cunning, with her modern grace, subdued me to her rate: she got the ring; and i had that which any inferior might at market-price have bought.  diana  i must be patient: you, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife, may justly diet me. i pray you yet; since you lack virtue, i will lose a husband; send for your ring, i will return it home, and give me mine again.  bertram  i have it not.  king  what ring was yours, i pray you?  diana  sir, much like the same upon your finger.  king  know you this ring? this ring was his of late.  diana  and this was it i gave him, being abed.  king  the story then goes false, you threw it him out of a casement.  diana                    i have spoke the truth. enter parolles  bertram  my lord, i do confess the ring was hers.  king  you boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you. is this the man you speak of?  diana  ay, my lord.  king  tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, i charge you, not fearing the displeasure of your master, which on your just proceeding i'll keep off, by him and by this woman here what know you?  parolles  so please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.  king  come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?  parolles  faith, sir, he did love her; but how?  king  how, i pray you?  parolles  he did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.  king  how is that?  parolles  he loved her, sir, and loved her not.  king  as thou art a knave, and no knave. what an equivocal companion is this!  parolles  i am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.  lafeu  he's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.  diana  do you know he promised me marriage?  parolles  faith, i know more than i'll speak.  king  but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?  parolles  yes, so please your majesty. i did go between them, as i said; but more than that, he loved her: for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know not what: yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore i will not speak what i know.  king  thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married: but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. this ring, you say, was yours?  diana  ay, my good lord.  king  where did you buy it? or who gave it you?  diana  it was not given me, nor i did not buy it.  king  who lent it you?  diana                    it was not lent me neither.  king  where did you find it, then?  diana  i found it not.  king  if it were yours by none of all these ways, how could you give it him?  diana  i never gave it him.  lafeu  this woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.  king  this ring was mine; i gave it his first wife.  diana  it might be yours or hers, for aught i know.  king  take her away; i do not like her now; to prison with her: and away with him. unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring, thou diest within this hour.  diana  i'll never tell you.  king  take her away.  diana                    i'll put in bail, my liege.  king  i think thee now some common customer.  diana  by jove, if ever i knew man, 'twas you.  king  wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?  diana  because he's guilty, and he is not guilty: he knows i am no maid, and he'll swear to't; i'll swear i am a maid, and he knows not. great king, i am no strumpet, by my life; i am either maid, or else this old man's wife.  king  she does abuse our ears: to prison with her.  diana  good mother, fetch my bail. stay, royal sir: exit widow the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, and he shall surety me. but for this lord, who hath abused me, as he knows himself, though yet he never harm'd me, here i quit him: he knows himself my bed he hath defiled; and at that time he got his wife with child: dead though she be, she feels her young one kick: so there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick: and now behold the meaning. re-enter widow, with helena  king  is there no exorcist beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?

 lafeu  he hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.  countess  this young gentlewoman had a father,--o, that 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. would, for the king's sake, he were living! i think it would be the death of the king's disease.  lafeu  how called you the man you speak of, madam?  countess  he was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: gerard de narbon.  lafeu  he was excellent indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.  bertram  what is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?  lafeu  a fistula, my lord.  bertram  i heard not of it before.  lafeu  i would it were not notorious. was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon?  countess  his sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. i have those hopes of her good that her education promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.  lafeu  your commendations, madam, get from her tears.  countess  'tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. no more of this, helena; go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it.  helena  i do affect a sorrow indeed, but i have it too.  lafeu  moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.  countess  if the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.  bertram  madam, i desire your holy wishes.  lafeu  how understand we that?  countess  be thou blest, bertram, and succeed thy father in manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness share with thy birthright! love all, trust a few, do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy rather in power than use, and keep thy friend under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence, but never tax'd for speech. what heaven more will, that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, fall on thy head! farewell, my lord; 'tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, advise him.  lafeu            he cannot want the best that shall attend his love.  countess  heaven bless him! farewell, bertram. exit  bertram  [to helena]  the best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you! be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.  lafeu  farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father. exeunt bertram and lafeu  helena  o, were that all! i think not on my father; and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him. what was he like? i have forgot him: my imagination carries no favour in't but bertram's. i am undone: there is no living, none, if bertram be away. 'twere all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it, he is so above me: in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted, not in his sphere. the ambition in my love thus plagues itself: the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love. 'twas pretty, though plague, to see him every hour; to sit and draw his arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, in our heart's table; heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour: but now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques. who comes here? enter parolles aside one that goes with him: i love him for his sake; and yet i know him a notorious liar, think him a great way fool, solely a coward; yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him, that they take place, when virtue's steely bones look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.  parolles  save you, fair queen!  helena  and you, monarch!  parolles  no.  helena  and no.  parolles  are you meditating on virginity?  helena  ay. you have some stain of soldier in you: let me ask you a question. man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?  parolles  keep him out.  helena  but he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some warlike resistance.  parolles  there is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.  helena  bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men?  parolles  virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. that you were made of is metal to make virgins. virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!  helena  i will stand for 't a little, though therefore i die a virgin.  parolles  there's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature. to speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. he that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!  helena  how might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?  parolles  let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not now. your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our french withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?  helena  not my virginity yet [         ] there shall your master have a thousand loves, a mother and a mistress and a friend, a phoenix, captain and an enemy, a guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, a counsellor, a traitress, and a dear; his humble ambition, proud humility, his jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, his faith, his sweet disaster; with a world of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms, that blinking cupid gossips. now shall he-- i know not what he shall. god send him well! the court's a learning place, and he is one--  parolles  what one, i' faith?  helena  that i wish well. 'tis pity--  parolles  what's pity?  helena  that wishing well had not a body in't, which might be felt; that we, the poorer born, whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, might with effects of them follow our friends, and show what we alone must think, which never return us thanks. enter page  page  monsieur parolles, my lord calls for you. exit  parolles  little helen, farewell; if i can remember thee, i will think of thee at court.  helena  monsieur parolles, you were born under a charitable star.  parolles  under mars, i.  helena  i especially think, under mars.  parolles  why under mars?  helena  the wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars.  parolles  when he was predominant.  helena  when he was retrograde, i think, rather.  parolles  why think you so?  helena  you go so much backward when you fight.  parolles  that's for advantage.  helena  so is running away, when fear proposes the safety; but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and i like the wear well.  parolles  i am so full of businesses, i cannot answer thee acutely. i will return perfect courtier; in the which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. when thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell. exit  helena  our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky gives us free scope, only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull. what power is it which mounts my love so high, that makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things. impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been cannot be: who ever strove so show her merit, that did miss her love?

get you gone, sirrah: the complaints i have heard of you i do not all believe: 'tis my slowness that i do not; for i know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.  clown  'tis not unknown to you, madam, i am a poor fellow.  countess  well, sir.  clown  no, madam, 'tis not so well that i am poor, though many of the rich are damned: but, if i may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world, isbel the woman and i will do as we may.  countess  wilt thou needs be a beggar?  clown  i do beg your good will in this case.  countess  in what case?  clown  in isbel's case and mine own. service is no heritage: and i think i shall never have the blessing of god till i have issue o' my body; for they say barnes are blessings.  countess  tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.  clown  my poor body, madam, requires it: i am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.  countess  is this all your worship's reason?  clown  faith, madam, i have other holy reasons such as they are.  countess  may the world know them?  clown  i have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, i do marry that i may repent.  countess  thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.  clown  i am out o' friends, madam; and i hope to have friends for my wife's sake.  countess  such friends are thine enemies, knave.  clown  you're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which i am aweary of. he that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop; if i be his cuckold, he's my drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. if men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together, like any deer i' the herd.  countess  wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?  clown  a prophet i, madam; and i speak the truth the next way: for i the ballad will repeat, which men full true shall find; your marriage comes by destiny, your cuckoo sings by kind.  countess  get you gone, sir; i'll talk with you more anon.  steward  may it please you, madam, that he bid helen come to you: of her i am to speak.  countess  sirrah, tell my gentlewoman i would speak with her; helen, i mean.  clown       was this fair face the cause, quoth she, why the grecians sacked troy? fond done, done fond, was this king priam's joy? with that she sighed as she stood, with that she sighed as she stood, and gave this sentence then; among nine bad if one be good, among nine bad if one be good, there's yet one good in ten.  countess  what, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.  clown  one good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o' the song: would god would serve the world so all the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman, if i were the parson. one in ten, quoth a'! an we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck one.  countess  you'll be gone, sir knave, and do as i command you.  clown  that man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done! though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. i am going, forsooth: the business is for helen to come hither. exit  countess  well, now.  steward  i know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.  countess  faith, i do: her father bequeathed her to me; and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds: there is more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid her than she'll demand.  steward  madam, i was very late more near her than i think she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, i dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. her matter was, she loved your son: fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level; dian no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. this she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er i heard virgin exclaim in: which i held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.  countess  you have discharged this honestly; keep it to yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that i could neither believe nor misdoubt. pray you, leave me: stall this in your bosom; and i thank you for your honest care: i will speak with you further anon. exit steward enter helena even so it was with me when i was young: if ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong; our blood to us, this to our blood is born; it is the show and seal of nature's truth, where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth: by our remembrances of days foregone, such were our faults, or then we thought them none. her eye is sick on't: i observe her now.  helena  what is your pleasure, madam?  countess  you know, helen, i am a mother to you.  helena  mine honourable mistress.  countess  nay, a mother: why not a mother? when i said 'a mother,' methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,' that you start at it? i say, i am your mother; and put you in the catalogue of those that were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen adoption strives with nature and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds: you ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan, yet i express to you a mother's care: god's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood to say i am thy mother? what's the matter, that this distemper'd messenger of wet, the many-colour'd iris, rounds thine eye? why? that you are my daughter?  helena  that i am not.  countess  i say, i am your mother.  helena  pardon, madam; the count rousillon cannot be my brother: i am from humble, he from honour'd name; no note upon my parents, his all noble: my master, my dear lord he is; and i his servant live, and will his vassal die: he must not be my brother.  countess  nor i your mother?  helena  you are my mother, madam; would you were,-- so that my lord your son were not my brother,-- indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers, i care no more for than i do for heaven, so i were not his sister. can't no other, but, i your daughter, he must be my brother?  countess  yes, helen, you might be my daughter-in-law: god shield you mean it not! daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse. what, pale again? my fear hath catch'd your fondness: now i see the mystery of your loneliness, and find your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross you love my son; invention is ashamed, against the proclamation of thy passion, to say thou dost not: therefore tell me true; but tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors that in their kind they speak it: only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue, that truth should be suspected. speak, is't so? if it be so, you have wound a goodly clew; if it be not, forswear't: howe'er, i charge thee, as heaven shall work in me for thine avail, tell me truly.  helena                    good madam, pardon me!  countess  do you love my son?  helena  your pardon, noble mistress!  countess  love you my son?  helena                    do not you love him, madam?  countess  go not about; my love hath in't a bond, whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose the state of your affection; for your passions have to the full appeach'd.  helena  then, i confess, here on my knee, before high heaven and you, that before you, and next unto high heaven, i love your son. my friends were poor, but honest; so's my love: be not offended; for it hurts not him that he is loved of me: i follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit; nor would i have him till i do deserve him; yet never know how that desert should be. i know i love in vain, strive against hope; yet in this captious and intenible sieve i still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still: thus, indian-like, religious in mine error, i adore the sun, that looks upon his worshipper, but knows of him no more. my dearest madam, let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do: but if yourself, whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly, that your dian was both herself and love: o, then, give pity to her, whose state is such that cannot choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose; that seeks not to find that her search implies, but riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!  countess  had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,-- to go to paris?  helena                    madam, i had.  countess  wherefore? tell true.  helena  i will tell truth; by grace itself i swear. you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and proved effects, such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty; and that he will'd me in heedfull'st reservation to bestow them, as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note: amongst the rest, there is a remedy, approved, set down, to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is render'd lost.  countess  this was your motive for paris, was it?

he and his physicians are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him, they, that they cannot help: how shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin, when the schools, embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off the danger to itself?  helena  there's something in't, more than my father's skill, which was the greatest of his profession, that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour but give me leave to try success, i'ld venture the well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure by such a day and hour.  countess  dost thou believe't?  helena  ay, madam, knowingly.  countess  why, helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, means and attendants and my loving greetings to those of mine in court: i'll stay at home and pray god's blessing into thy attempt: be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this, what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss. exeunt  act ii scene i. paris. the king's palace.  flourish of cornets. enter the king, attended  with divers young lords taking leave for the florentine war; bertram, and parolles  king  farewell, young lords; these warlike principles do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell: share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all the gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received, and is enough for both.  first lord  'tis our hope, sir, after well enter'd soldiers, to return and find your grace in health.  king  no, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart will not confess he owes the malady that doth my life besiege. farewell, young lords; whether i live or die, be you the sons of worthy frenchmen: let higher italy,-- those bated that inherit but the fall of the last monarchy,--see that you come not to woo honour, but to wed it; when the bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek, that fame may cry you loud: i say, farewell.  second lord  health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!  king  those girls of italy, take heed of them: they say, our french lack language to deny, if they demand: beware of being captives, before you serve.  both                    our hearts receive your warnings.  king  farewell. come hither to me. exit, attended  first lord  o, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!  parolles  'tis not his fault, the spark.  second lord  o, 'tis brave wars!  parolles  most admirable: i have seen those wars.  bertram  i am commanded here, and kept a coil with 'too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'  parolles  an thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.  bertram  i shall stay here the forehorse to a smock, creaking my shoes on the plain masonry, till honour be bought up and no sword worn but one to dance with! by heaven, i'll steal away.  first lord  there's honour in the theft.  parolles  commit it, count.  second lord  i am your accessary; and so, farewell.  bertram  i grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.  first lord  farewell, captain.  second lord  sweet monsieur parolles!  parolles  noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the spinii one captain spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrenched it: say to him, i live; and observe his reports for me.  first lord  we shall, noble captain. exeunt lords  parolles  mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?

 king  no.  lafeu  o, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox? yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if my royal fox could reach them: i have seen a medicine that's able to breathe life into a stone, quicken a rock, and make you dance canary with spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch, is powerful to araise king pepin, nay, to give great charlemain a pen in's hand, and write to her a love-line.  king  what 'her' is this?  lafeu  why, doctor she: my lord, there's one arrived, if you will see her: now, by my faith and honour, if seriously i may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance, i have spoke with one that, in her sex, her years, profession, wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more than i dare blame my weakness: will you see her for that is her demand, and know her business? that done, laugh well at me.  king  now, good lafeu, bring in the admiration; that we with thee may spend our wonder too, or take off thine by wondering how thou took'st it.  lafeu  nay, i'll fit you, and not be all day neither. exit  king  thus he his special nothing ever prologues. re-enter lafeu, with helena  lafeu  nay, come your ways.  king  this haste hath wings indeed.  lafeu  nay, come your ways: this is his majesty; say your mind to him: a traitor you do look like; but such traitors his majesty seldom fears: i am cressid's uncle, that dare leave two together; fare you well. exit  king  now, fair one, does your business follow us?  helena  ay, my good lord. gerard de narbon was my father; in what he did profess, well found.  king  i knew him.  helena  the rather will i spare my praises towards him: knowing him is enough. on's bed of death many receipts he gave me: chiefly one. which, as the dearest issue of his practise, and of his old experience the oily darling, he bade me store up, as a triple eye, safer than mine own two, more dear; i have so; and hearing your high majesty is touch'd with that malignant cause wherein the honour of my dear father's gift stands chief in power, i come to tender it and my appliance with all bound humbleness.  king  we thank you, maiden; but may not be so credulous of cure, when our most learned doctors leave us and the congregated college have concluded that labouring art can never ransom nature from her inaidible estate; i say we must not so stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope, to prostitute our past-cure malady to empirics, or to dissever so our great self and our credit, to esteem a senseless help when help past sense we deem.  helena  my duty then shall pay me for my pains: i will no more enforce mine office on you. humbly entreating from your royal thoughts a modest one, to bear me back again.  king  i cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful: thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks i give as one near death to those that wish him live: but what at full i know, thou know'st no part, i knowing all my peril, thou no art.  helena  what i can do can do no hurt to try, since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy. he that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister: so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown, when judges have been babes; great floods have flown from simple sources, and great seas have dried when miracles have by the greatest been denied. oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises, and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits.  king  i must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid; thy pains not used must by thyself be paid: proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.  helena  inspired merit so by breath is barr'd: it is not so with him that all things knows as 'tis with us that square our guess by shows; but most it is presumption in us when the help of heaven we count the act of men. dear sir, to my endeavours give consent; of heaven, not me, make an experiment. i am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim; but know i think and think i know most sure my art is not past power nor you past cure.  king  are thou so confident? within what space hopest thou my cure?  helena  the great'st grace lending grace ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring their fiery torcher his diurnal ring, ere twice in murk and occidental damp moist hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp, or four and twenty times the pilot's glass hath told the thievish minutes how they pass, what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly, health shall live free and sickness freely die.  king  upon thy certainty and confidence what darest thou venture?  helena  tax of impudence, a strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended with vilest torture let my life be ended.  king  methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak his powerful sound within an organ weak: and what impossibility would slay in common sense, sense saves another way. thy life is dear; for all that life can rate worth name of life in thee hath estimate, youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all that happiness and prime can happy call: thou this to hazard needs must intimate skill infinite or monstrous desperate. sweet practiser, thy physic i will try, that ministers thine own death if i die.  helena  if i break time, or flinch in property of what i spoke, unpitied let me die, and well deserved: not helping, death's my fee; but, if i help, what do you promise me?  king  make thy demand.  helena                    but will you make it even?  king  ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.  helena  then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand what husband in thy power i will command: exempted be from me the arrogance to choose from forth the royal blood of france, my low and humble name to propagate with any branch or image of thy state; but such a one, thy vassal, whom i know is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.  king  here is my hand; the premises observed, thy will by my performance shall be served: so make the choice of thy own time, for i, thy resolved patient, on thee still rely. more should i question thee, and more i must, though more to know could not be more to trust, from whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest. give me some help here, ho! if thou proceed as high as word, my deed shall match thy meed. flourish. exeunt  scene ii. rousillon. the count's palace.  enter countess and clown  countess  come on, sir; i shall now put you to the height of your breeding.  clown  i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: i know my business is but to the court.  countess  to the court! why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? but to the court!  clown  truly, madam, if god have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, i have an answer will serve all men.  countess  marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.  clown  it is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks, the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.  countess  will your answer serve fit to all questions?  clown  as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your french crown for your taffeta punk, as tib's rush for tom's forefinger, as a pancake for shrove tuesday, a morris for may-day, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.  countess  have you, i say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?  clown  from below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.  countess  it must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.  clown  but a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that belongs to't. ask me if i am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.  countess  to be young again, if we could: i will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. i pray you, sir, are you a courtier?  clown  o lord, sir! there's a simple putting off. more, more, a hundred of them.  countess  sir, i am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.  clown  o lord, sir! thick, thick, spare not me.  countess  i think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.  clown  o lord, sir! nay, put me to't, i warrant you.  countess  you were lately whipped, sir, as i think.  clown  o lord, sir! spare not me.  countess  do you cry, 'o lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare not me?' indeed your 'o lord, sir!' is very sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.  clown  i ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'o lord, sir!' i see things may serve long, but not serve ever.  countess  i play the noble housewife with the time to entertain't so merrily with a fool.  clown  o lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.  countess  an end, sir; to your business. give helen this, and urge her to a present answer back: commend me to my kinsmen and my son: this is not much.  clown  not much commendation to them.  countess  not much employment for you: you understand me?

 bertram  yes, my good lord; but never hope to know why i should marry her.  king  thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.  bertram  but follows it, my lord, to bring me down must answer for your raising? i know her well: she had her breeding at my father's charge. a poor physician's daughter my wife! disdain rather corrupt me ever!  king  'tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which i can build up. strange is it that our bloods, of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together, would quite confound distinction, yet stand off in differences so mighty. if she be all that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest, a poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest of virtue for the name: but do not so: from lowest place when virtuous things proceed, the place is dignified by the doer's deed: where great additions swell's, and virtue none, it is a dropsied honour. good alone is good without a name. vileness is so: the property by what it is should go, not by the title. she is young, wise, fair; in these to nature she's immediate heir, and these breed honour: that is honour's scorn, which challenges itself as honour's born and is not like the sire: honours thrive, when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave a lying trophy, and as oft is dumb where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb of honour'd bones indeed. what should be said? if thou canst like this creature as a maid, i can create the rest: virtue and she is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.  bertram  i cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.  king  thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.  helena  that you are well restored, my lord, i'm glad: let the rest go.  king  my honour's at the stake; which to defeat, i must produce my power. here, take her hand, proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift; that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert; that canst not dream, we, poising us in her defective scale, shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know, it is in us to plant thine honour where we please to have it grow. cheque thy contempt: obey our will, which travails in thy good: believe not thy disdain, but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims; or i will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee, in the name of justice, without all terms of pity. speak; thine answer.  bertram  pardon, my gracious lord; for i submit my fancy to your eyes: when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it, i find that she, which late was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now the praised of the king; who, so ennobled, is as 'twere born so.  king  take her by the hand, and tell her she is thine: to whom i promise a counterpoise, if not to thy estate a balance more replete.  bertram  i take her hand.  king  good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract; whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the now-born brief, and be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space, expecting absent friends. as thou lovest her, thy love's to me religious; else, does err. exeunt all but lafeu and parolles  lafeu  [advancing]  do you hear, monsieur?

 clown  nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as i thought he would.  countess  why should he be killed?  clown  so say i, madam, if he run away, as i hear he does: the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of men, though it be the getting of children. here they come will tell you more: for my part, i only hear your son was run away. exit enter helena, and two gentlemen  first gentleman  save you, good madam.  helena  madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.  second gentleman  do not say so.  countess  think upon patience. pray you, gentlemen, i have felt so many quirks of joy and grief, that the first face of neither, on the start, can woman me unto't: where is my son, i pray you?

 first gentleman  ay, madam; and for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.  countess  i prithee, lady, have a better cheer; if thou engrossest all the griefs are thine, thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son; but i do wash his name out of my blood, and thou art all my child. towards florence is he?

 first gentleman  a servant only, and a gentleman which i have sometime known.  countess  parolles, was it not?  first gentleman  ay, my good lady, he.  countess  a very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness. my son corrupts a well-derived nature with his inducement.  first gentleman  indeed, good lady, the fellow has a deal of that too much, which holds him much to have.  countess  you're welcome, gentlemen. i will entreat you, when you see my son, to tell him that his sword can never win the honour that he loses: more i'll entreat you written to bear along.  second gentleman  we serve you, madam, in that and all your worthiest affairs.  countess  not so, but as we change our courtesies. will you draw near! exeunt countess and gentlemen  helena  'till i have no wife, i have nothing in france.' nothing in france, until he has no wife! thou shalt have none, rousillon, none in france; then hast thou all again. poor lord! is't i that chase thee from thy country and expose those tender limbs of thine to the event of the none-sparing war?

he cannot thrive, unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice. write, write, rinaldo, to this unworthy husband of his wife; let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light: my greatest grief. though little he do feel it, set down sharply. dispatch the most convenient messenger: when haply he shall hear that she is gone, he will return; and hope i may that she, hearing so much, will speed her foot again, led hither by pure love: which of them both is dearest to me. i have no skill in sense to make distinction: provide this messenger: my heart is heavy and mine age is weak; grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak. exeunt  scene v. florence. without the walls. a tucket afar off.  enter an old widow of florence, diana, violenta, and mariana, with other citizens  widow  nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we shall lose all the sight.  diana  they say the french count has done most honourable service.  widow  it is reported that he has taken their greatest commander; and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother. tucket we have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.  mariana  come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it. well, diana, take heed of this french earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and no legacy is so rich as honesty.  widow  i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.  mariana  i know that knave; hang him! one parolles: a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. beware of them, diana; their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them. i hope i need not to advise you further; but i hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.  diana  you shall not need to fear me.  widow  i hope so. enter helena, disguised like a pilgrim look, here comes a pilgrim: i know she will lie at my house; thither they send one another: i'll question her. god save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?

 widow  if you shall please so, pilgrim.  helena  i thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.  widow  you came, i think, from france?  helena  i did so.  widow  here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service.  helena  his name, i pray you.  diana  the count rousillon: know you such a one?  helena  but by the ear, that hears most nobly of him: his face i know not.  diana  whatsome'er he is, he's bravely taken here. he stole from france, as 'tis reported, for the king had married him against his liking: think you it is so?  helena  ay, surely, mere the truth: i know his lady.  diana  there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her.  helena  what's his name?  diana  monsieur parolles.  helena                    o, i believe with him, in argument of praise, or to the worth of the great count himself, she is too mean to have her name repeated: all her deserving is a reserved honesty, and that i have not heard examined.  diana  alas, poor lady! 'tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord.  widow  i warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is, her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her a shrewd turn, if she pleased.  helena  how do you mean? may be the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose.  widow  he does indeed; and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid: but she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence.  mariana  the gods forbid else!  widow  so, now they come: drum and colours enter bertram, parolles, and the whole army that is antonio, the duke's eldest son; that, escalus.  helena                    which is the frenchman?

 diana  that jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?  helena  perchance he's hurt i' the battle.  parolles  lose our drum! well.  mariana  he's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.  widow  marry, hang you!  mariana  and your courtesy, for a ring-carrier! exeunt bertram, parolles, and army  widow  the troop is past. come, pilgrim, i will bring you where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents there's four or five, to great saint jaques bound, already at my house.  helena  i humbly thank you: please it this matron and this gentle maid to eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking shall be for me; and, to requite you further, i will bestow some precepts of this virgin worthy the note.  both                    we'll take your offer kindly. exeunt  scene vi. camp before florence.  enter bertram and the two french lords  second lord  nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.  first lord  if your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect.  second lord  on my life, my lord, a bubble.  bertram  do you think i am so far deceived in him?  second lord  believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment.  first lord  it were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.  bertram  i would i knew in what particular action to try him.  first lord  none better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.  second lord  i, with a troop of florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such i will have, whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. be but your lordship present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing.  first lord  o, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for't: when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not john drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. here he comes. enter parolles  second lord  [aside to bertram]  o, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand.  bertram  how now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition.  first lord  a pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.  parolles  'but a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? a drum so lost! there was excellent command,--to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!  first lord  that was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.  bertram  well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recovered.  parolles  it might have been recovered.  bertram  it might; but it is not now.  parolles  it is to be recovered: but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, i would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'  bertram  why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it. and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.  parolles  by the hand of a soldier, i will undertake it.  bertram  but you must not now slumber in it.  parolles  i'll about it this evening: and i will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.  bertram  may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?  parolles  i know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt i vow.  bertram  i know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. farewell.  parolles  i love not many words. exit  second lord  no more than a fish loves water. is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to do't?  first lord  you do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out, you have him ever after.  bertram  why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?  second lord  none in the world; but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.  first lord  we'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night.  second lord  i must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.  bertram  your brother he shall go along with me.  second lord  as't please your lordship: i'll leave you. exit  bertram  now will i lead you to the house, and show you the lass i spoke of.  first lord  but you say she's honest.  bertram  that's all the fault: i spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold; but i sent to her, by this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind, tokens and letters which she did re-send; and this is all i have done. she's a fair creature: will you go see her?  first lord  with all my heart, my lord. exeunt  scene vii. florence. the widow's house.  enter helena and widow  helena  if you misdoubt me that i am not she, i know not how i shall assure you further, but i shall lose the grounds i work upon.  widow  though my estate be fallen, i was well born, nothing acquainted with these businesses; and would not put my reputation now in any staining act.  helena  nor would i wish you. first, give me trust, the count he is my husband, and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken is so from word to word; and then you cannot, by the good aid that i of you shall borrow, err in bestowing it.  widow  i should believe you: for you have show'd me that which well approves you're great in fortune.  helena  take this purse of gold, and let me buy your friendly help thus far, which i will over-pay and pay again when i have found it. the count he wooes your daughter, lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent, as we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it. now his important blood will nought deny that she'll demand: a ring the county wears, that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son, some four or five descents since the first father wore it: this ring he holds in most rich choice; yet in his idle fire, to buy his will, it would not seem too dear, howe'er repented after.  widow  now i see the bottom of your purpose.  helena  you see it lawful, then: it is no more, but that your daughter, ere she seems as won, desires this ring; appoints him an encounter; in fine, delivers me to fill the time, herself most chastely absent: after this, to marry her, i'll add three thousand crowns to what is passed already.  widow  i have yielded: instruct my daughter how she shall persever, that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent. every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs composed to her unworthiness: it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves; for he persists as if his life lay on't.  helena  why then to-night let us assay our plot; which, if it speed, is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act, where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact: but let's about it. exeunt  act iv scene i. without the florentine camp.  enter second french lord, with five or six other soldiers in ambush  second lord  he can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. when you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will: though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter.  first soldier  good captain, let me be the interpreter.  second lord  art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?  first soldier  no, sir, i warrant you.  second lord  but what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?  first soldier  e'en such as you speak to me.  second lord  he must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment. now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language, gabble enough, and good enough. as for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. but couch, ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. enter parolles  parolles  ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. what shall i say i have done? it must be a very plausive invention that carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door. i find my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of mars before it and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.  second lord  this is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of.  parolles  what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing i had no such purpose? i must give myself some hurts, and say i got them in exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they will say, 'came you off with so little?' and great ones i dare not give. wherefore, what's the instance? tongue, i must put you into a butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.  second lord  is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?

if quick fire of youth light not your mind, you are no maiden, but a monument: when you are dead, you should be such a one as you are now, for you are cold and stem; and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got.  diana  she then was honest.  bertram  so should you be.  diana  no: my mother did but duty; such, my lord, as you owe to your wife.  bertram  no more o' that; i prithee, do not strive against my vows: i was compell'd to her; but i love thee by love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever do thee all rights of service.  diana  ay, so you serve us till we serve you; but when you have our roses, you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness.  bertram  how have i sworn!  diana  'tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, but the plain single vow that is vow'd true. what is not holy, that we swear not by, but take the high'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me, if i should swear by god's great attributes, i loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, when i did love you ill? this has no holding, to swear by him whom i protest to love, that i will work against him: therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd, at least in my opinion.  bertram  change it, change it; be not so holy-cruel: love is holy; and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts that you do charge men with. stand no more off, but give thyself unto my sick desires, who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever my love as it begins shall so persever.  diana  i see that men make ropes in such a scarre that we'll forsake ourselves. give me that ring.  bertram  i'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power to give it from me.  diana  will you not, my lord?  bertram  it is an honour 'longing to our house, bequeathed down from many ancestors; which were the greatest obloquy i' the world in me to lose.  diana                    mine honour's such a ring: my chastity's the jewel of our house, bequeathed down from many ancestors; which were the greatest obloquy i' the world in me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part, against your vain assault.  bertram  here, take my ring: my house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine, and i'll be bid by thee.  diana  when midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window: i'll order take my mother shall not hear. now will i charge you in the band of truth, when you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed, remain there but an hour, nor speak to me: my reasons are most strong; and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliver'd: and on your finger in the night i'll put another ring, that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds. adieu, till then; then, fail not. you have won a wife of me, though there my hope be done.  bertram  a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee. exit  diana  for which live long to thank both heaven and me! you may so in the end. my mother told me just how he would woo, as if she sat in 's heart; she says all men have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me when his wife's dead; therefore i'll lie with him when i am buried. since frenchmen are so braid, marry that will, i live and die a maid: only in this disguise i think't no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win. exit  scene iii. the florentine camp.  enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers  first lord  you have not given him his mother's letter?  second lord  i have delivered it an hour since: there is something in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he changed almost into another man.  first lord  he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.  second lord  especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. i will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.  first lord  when you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and i am the grave of it.  second lord  he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.  first lord  now, god delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, what things are we!  second lord  merely our own traitors. and as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.  first lord  is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? we shall not then have his company to-night?  second lord  not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.  first lord  that approaches apace; i would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.  second lord  we will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other.  first lord  in the mean time, what hear you of these wars?  second lord  i hear there is an overture of peace.  first lord  nay, i assure you, a peace concluded.  second lord  what will count rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again into france?  first lord  i perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.  second lord  let it be forbid, sir; so should i be a great deal of his act.  first lord  sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.  second lord  how is this justified?  first lord  the stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place.  second lord  hath the count all this intelligence?  first lord  ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, so to the full arming of the verity.  second lord  i am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.  first lord  how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!  second lord  and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.  first lord  the web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues. enter a messenger how now! where's your master?  servant  he met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for france. the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king.  second lord  they shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.  first lord  they cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness. here's his lordship now. enter bertram how now, my lord! is't not after midnight?  bertram  i have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success: i have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my lady mother i am returning; entertained my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but that i have not ended yet.  second lord  if the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.  bertram  i mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? come, bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier.  second lord  bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.  bertram  no matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. how does he carry himself?  second lord  i have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. but to answer you as you would be understood; he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?  bertram  nothing of me, has a'?  second lord  his confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face: if your lordship be in't, as i believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it. enter parolles guarded, and first soldier  bertram  a plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me: hush, hush!  first lord  hoodman comes! portotartarosa  first soldier  he calls for the tortures: what will you say without 'em?  parolles  i will confess what i know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, i can say no more.  first soldier  bosko chimurcho.  first lord  boblibindo chicurmurco.  first soldier  you are a merciful general. our general bids you answer to what i shall ask you out of a note.  parolles  and truly, as i hope to live.  first soldier  [reads]  'first demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.' what say you to that?  parolles  five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit and as i hope to live.  first soldier  shall i set down your answer so?  parolles  do: i'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.  bertram  all's one to him. what a past-saving slave is this!  first lord  you're deceived, my lord: this is monsieur parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of his dagger.  second lord  i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly.  first soldier  well, that's set down.  parolles  five or six thousand horse, i said,-- i will say true,--or thereabouts, set down, for i'll speak truth.  first lord  he's very near the truth in this.  bertram  but i con him no thanks for't, in the nature he delivers it.  parolles  poor rogues, i pray you, say.  first soldier  well, that's set down.  parolles  i humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor.  first soldier  [reads]  'demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot.' what say you to that?  parolles  by my troth, sir, if i were to live this present hour, i will tell true. let me see: spurio, a hundred and fifty; sebastian, so many; corambus, so many; jaques, so many; guiltian, cosmo, lodowick, and gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own company, chitopher, vaumond, bentii, two hundred and fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.  bertram  what shall be done to him?  first lord  nothing, but let him have thanks. demand of him my condition, and what credit i have with the duke.  first soldier  well, that's set down. reads 'you shall demand of him, whether one captain dumain be i' the camp, a frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to revolt.' what say you to this? what do you know of it?  parolles  i beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories: demand them singly.  first soldier  do you know this captain dumain?  parolles  i know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay.  bertram  nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.  first soldier  well, is this captain in the duke of florence's camp?  parolles  upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.  first lord  nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.  first soldier  what is his reputation with the duke?  parolles  the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band: i think i have his letter in my pocket.  first soldier  marry, we'll search.  parolles  in good sadness, i do not know; either it is there, or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent.  first soldier  here 'tis; here's a paper: shall i read it to you?  parolles  i do not know if it be it or no.  bertram  our interpreter does it well.  first lord  excellently.  first soldier  [reads]  'dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--  parolles  that is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence, one diana, to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish: i pray you, sir, put it up again.  first soldier  nay, i'll read it first, by your favour.  parolles  my meaning in't, i protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.  bertram  damnable both-sides rogue!  first soldier  [reads]  'when he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it; after he scores, he never pays the score: half won is match well made; match, and well make it; he ne'er pays after-debts, take it before; and say a soldier, dian, told thee this, men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss: for count of this, the count's a fool, i know it, who pays before, but not when he does owe it. thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear, parolles.'  bertram  he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in's forehead.  second lord  this is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.  bertram  i could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me.  first soldier  i perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be fain to hang you.  parolles  my life, sir, in any case: not that i am afraid to die; but that, my offences being many, i would repent out the remainder of nature: let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so i may live.  first soldier  we'll see what may be done, so you confess freely; therefore, once more to this captain dumain: you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is his honesty?  parolles  he will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus: he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than hercules: he will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. i have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has every thing that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing.  first lord  i begin to love him for this.  bertram  for this description of thine honesty? a pox upon him for me, he's more and more a cat.  first soldier  what say you to his expertness in war?  parolles  faith, sir, he has led the drum before the english tragedians; to belie him, i will not, and more of his soldiership i know not; except, in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: i would do the man what honour i can, but of this i am not certain.  first lord  he hath out-villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him.  bertram  a pox on him, he's a cat still.  first soldier  his qualities being at this poor price, i need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.  parolles  sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.  first soldier  what's his brother, the other captain dumain?  second lord  why does be ask him of me?  first soldier  what's he?  parolles  e'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is: in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.  first soldier  if your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the florentine?  parolles  ay, and the captain of his horse, count rousillon.  first soldier  i'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.  parolles  [aside]  i'll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have i run into this danger. yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken?  first soldier  there is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the general says, you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. come, headsman, off with his head.  parolles  o lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!  first lord  that shall you, and take your leave of all your friends. unblinding him so, look about you: know you any here?

a quart d'ecu for you: let the justices make you and fortune friends: i am for other business.  parolles  i beseech your honour to hear me one single word.  lafeu  you beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't; save your word.  parolles  my name, my good lord, is parolles.  lafeu  you beg more than 'word,' then. cox my passion! give me your hand. how does your drum?  parolles  o my good lord, you were the first that found me!  lafeu  was i, in sooth? and i was the first that lost thee.  parolles  it lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out.  lafeu  out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of god and the devil? one brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out. trumpets sound the king's coming; i know by his trumpets. sirrah, inquire further after me; i had talk of you last night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat; go to, follow.  parolles  i praise god for you. exeunt  scene iii. rousillon. the count's palace.  flourish. enter king, countess, lafeu, the two french lords, with attendants  king  we lost a jewel of her; and our esteem was made much poorer by it: but your son, as mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know her estimation home.  countess  'tis past, my liege; and i beseech your majesty to make it natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth; when oil and fire, too strong for reason's force, o'erbears it and burns on.  king  my honour'd lady, i have forgiven and forgotten all; though my revenges were high bent upon him, and watch'd the time to shoot.  lafeu  this i must say, but first i beg my pardon, the young lord did to his majesty, his mother and his lady offence of mighty note; but to himself the greatest wrong of all. he lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive, whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve humbly call'd mistress.  king  praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear. well, call him hither; we are reconciled, and the first view shall kill all repetition: let him not ask our pardon; the nature of his great offence is dead, and deeper than oblivion we do bury the incensing relics of it: let him approach, a stranger, no offender; and inform him so 'tis our will he should.  gentleman  i shall, my liege. exit  king  what says he to your daughter? have you spoke?  lafeu  all that he is hath reference to your highness.  king  then shall we have a match. i have letters sent me that set him high in fame. enter bertram  lafeu  he looks well on't.  king  i am not a day of season, for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once: but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth; the time is fair again.  bertram  my high-repented blames, dear sovereign, pardon to me.  king  all is whole; not one word more of the consumed time. let's take the instant by the forward top; for we are old, and on our quick'st decrees the inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them. you remember the daughter of this lord?  bertram  admiringly, my liege, at first i stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing, contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, which warp'd the line of every other favour; scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen; extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object: thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself, since i have lost, have loved, was in mine eye the dust that did offend it.  king  well excused: that thou didst love her, strikes some scores away from the great compt: but love that comes too late, like a remorseful pardon slowly carried, to the great sender turns a sour offence, crying, 'that's good that's gone.' our rash faults make trivial price of serious things we have, not knowing them until we know their grave: oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, destroy our friends and after weep their dust our own love waking cries to see what's done, while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon. be this sweet helen's knell, and now forget her. send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin: the main consents are had; and here we'll stay to see our widower's second marriage-day.  countess  which better than the first, o dear heaven, bless! or, ere they meet, in me, o nature, cesse!  lafeu  come on, my son, in whom my house's name must be digested, give a favour from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, that she may quickly come. bertram gives a ring by my old beard, and every hair that's on't, helen, that's dead, was a sweet creature: such a ring as this, the last that e'er i took her at court, i saw upon her finger.  bertram  hers it was not.  king  now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye, while i was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't. this ring was mine; and, when i gave it helen, i bade her, if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help, that by this token i would relieve her. had you that craft, to reave her of what should stead her most?  bertram  my gracious sovereign, howe'er it pleases you to take it so, the ring was never hers.  countess  son, on my life, i have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it at her life's rate.  lafeu  i am sure i saw her wear it.  bertram  you are deceived, my lord; she never saw it: in florence was it from a casement thrown me, wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought i stood engaged: but when i had subscribed to mine own fortune and inform'd her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture, she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again.  king  plutus himself, that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, hath not in nature's mystery more science than i have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas helen's, whoever gave it you. then, if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself, confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement you got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger, unless she gave it to yourself in bed, where you have never come, or sent it us upon her great disaster.  bertram  she never saw it.  king  thou speak'st it falsely, as i love mine honour; and makest conjectural fears to come into me which i would fain shut out. if it should prove that thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;-- and yet i know not: thou didst hate her deadly, and she is dead; which nothing, but to close her eyes myself, could win me to believe, more than to see this ring. take him away. guards seize bertram my fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall, shall tax my fears of little vanity, having vainly fear'd too little. away with him! we'll sift this matter further.  bertram  if you shall prove this ring was ever hers, you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence, where yet she never was. exit, guarded  king  i am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings. enter a gentleman  gentleman  gracious sovereign, whether i have been to blame or no, i know not: here's a petition from a florentine, who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself. i undertook it, vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant, who by this i know is here attending: her business looks in her with an importing visage; and she told me, in a sweet verbal brief, it did concern your highness with herself.  king  [reads]  upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, i blush to say it, he won me. now is the count rousillon a widower: his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. he stole from florence, taking no leave, and i follow him to his country for justice: grant it me, o king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. diana capilet.  lafeu  i will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this: i'll none of him.  king  the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu, to bring forth this discovery. seek these suitors: go speedily and bring again the count. i am afeard the life of helen, lady, was foully snatch'd.  countess  now, justice on the doers! re-enter bertram, guarded  king  i wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you, and that you fly them as you swear them lordship, yet you desire to marry. enter widow and diana what woman's that?  diana  i am, my lord, a wretched florentine, derived from the ancient capilet: my suit, as i do understand, you know, and therefore know how far i may be pitied.  widow  i am her mother, sir, whose age and honour both suffer under this complaint we bring, and both shall cease, without your remedy.  king  come hither, count; do you know these women?  bertram  my lord, i neither can nor will deny but that i know them: do they charge me further?  diana  why do you look so strange upon your wife?  bertram  she's none of mine, my lord.  diana  if you shall marry, you give away this hand, and that is mine; you give away heaven's vows, and those are mine; you give away myself, which is known mine; for i by vow am so embodied yours, that she which marries you must marry me, either both or none.  lafeu  your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.  bertram  my lord, this is a fond and desperate creature, whom sometime i have laugh'd with: let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here.  king  sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies.  diana  good my lord, ask him upon his oath, if he does think he had not my virginity.  king  what say'st thou to her?  bertram  she's impudent, my lord, and was a common gamester to the camp.  diana  he does me wrong, my lord; if i were so, he might have bought me at a common price: do not believe him. o, behold this ring, whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel; yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o' the camp, if i be one.  countess                    he blushes, and 'tis it: of six preceding ancestors, that gem, conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue, hath it been owed and worn. this is his wife; that ring's a thousand proofs.  king  methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it.  diana  i did, my lord, but loath am to produce so bad an instrument: his name's parolles.  lafeu  i saw the man to-day, if man he be.  king  find him, and bring him hither. exit an attendant  bertram  what of him? he's quoted for a most perfidious slave, with all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd; whose nature sickens but to speak a truth. am i or that or this for what he'll utter, that will speak any thing?  king  she hath that ring of yours.  bertram  i think she has: certain it is i liked her, and boarded her i' the wanton way of youth: she knew her distance and did angle for me, madding my eagerness with her restraint, as all impediments in fancy's course are motives of more fancy; and, in fine, her infinite cunning, with her modern grace, subdued me to her rate: she got the ring; and i had that which any inferior might at market-price have bought.  diana  i must be patient: you, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife, may justly diet me. i pray you yet; since you lack virtue, i will lose a husband; send for your ring, i will return it home, and give me mine again.  bertram  i have it not.  king  what ring was yours, i pray you?  diana  sir, much like the same upon your finger.  king  know you this ring? this ring was his of late.  diana  and this was it i gave him, being abed.  king  the story then goes false, you threw it him out of a casement.  diana                    i have spoke the truth. enter parolles  bertram  my lord, i do confess the ring was hers.  king  you boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you. is this the man you speak of?  diana  ay, my lord.  king  tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, i charge you, not fearing the displeasure of your master, which on your just proceeding i'll keep off, by him and by this woman here what know you?  parolles  so please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.  king  come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?  parolles  faith, sir, he did love her; but how?  king  how, i pray you?  parolles  he did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.  king  how is that?  parolles  he loved her, sir, and loved her not.  king  as thou art a knave, and no knave. what an equivocal companion is this!  parolles  i am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.  lafeu  he's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.  diana  do you know he promised me marriage?  parolles  faith, i know more than i'll speak.  king  but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?  parolles  yes, so please your majesty. i did go between them, as i said; but more than that, he loved her: for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know not what: yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore i will not speak what i know.  king  thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married: but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. this ring, you say, was yours?  diana  ay, my good lord.  king  where did you buy it? or who gave it you?  diana  it was not given me, nor i did not buy it.  king  who lent it you?  diana                    it was not lent me neither.  king  where did you find it, then?  diana  i found it not.  king  if it were yours by none of all these ways, how could you give it him?  diana  i never gave it him.  lafeu  this woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.  king  this ring was mine; i gave it his first wife.  diana  it might be yours or hers, for aught i know.  king  take her away; i do not like her now; to prison with her: and away with him. unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring, thou diest within this hour.  diana  i'll never tell you.  king  take her away.  diana                    i'll put in bail, my liege.  king  i think thee now some common customer.  diana  by jove, if ever i knew man, 'twas you.  king  wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?  diana  because he's guilty, and he is not guilty: he knows i am no maid, and he'll swear to't; i'll swear i am a maid, and he knows not. great king, i am no strumpet, by my life; i am either maid, or else this old man's wife.  king  she does abuse our ears: to prison with her.  diana  good mother, fetch my bail. stay, royal sir: exit widow the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, and he shall surety me. but for this lord, who hath abused me, as he knows himself, though yet he never harm'd me, here i quit him: he knows himself my bed he hath defiled; and at that time he got his wife with child: dead though she be, she feels her young one kick: so there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick: and now behold the meaning. re-enter widow, with helena  king  is there no exorcist beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? is't real that i see?  helena  no, my good lord; 'tis but the shadow of a wife you see, the name and not the thing.  bertram  both, both. o, pardon!  helena  o my good lord, when i was like this maid, i found you wondrous kind. there is your ring; and, look you, here's your letter; this it says: 'when from my finger you can get this ring and are by me with child,'  & c. this is done: will you be mine, now you are doubly won?  bertram  if she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, i'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.  helena  if it appear not plain and prove untrue, deadly divorce step between me and you! o my dear mother, do i see you living?  lafeu  mine eyes smell onions; i shall weep anon: to parolles good tom drum, lend me a handkercher: so, i thank thee: wait on me home, i'll make sport with thee: let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.  king  let us from point to point this story know, to make the even truth in pleasure flow. to diana if thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower, choose thou thy husband, and i'll pay thy dower; for i can guess that by thy honest aid thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid. of that and all the progress, more or less, resolvedly more leisure shall express: all yet seems well; and if it end so meet, the bitter past, more welcome is the sweet. flourish epilogue  king  the king's a beggar, now the play is done: all is well ended, if this suit be won, that you express content; which we will pay, with strife to please you, day exceeding day: ours be your patience then, and yours our parts; your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts. exeunt   \n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GdOS0uHlFWNV","colab_type":"text"},"source":["###

all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature.\n","73   virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\n","74   besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon.\n","75   keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by't: out with

youth he had the wit which i can well observe to-day in our young lords; but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour; so like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness; if they were, his equal had awaked them, and his honour, clock to itself, knew the true minute when exception bid him speak, and at this time his tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him he used as creatures of another place and bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks, making them proud of his humility, in their poor praise he humbled.\n","129   such a man might be a copy to these younger times; which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now but goers backward.\n","130   bertram  his good remembrance, sir, lies richer in

out,--'let me not live,' quoth he, 'after my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain; whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies expire before their fashions.'\n","133   this he wish'd; i after him do after him wish too, since i nor wax nor honey can bring home, i quickly were dissolved from my hive,

got.\n","956   diana  she then was honest.\n","957   bertram  so should you be.\n","958   diana  no: my mother did but duty; such, my lord, as you owe to your wife.\n","959   bertram  no more o' that;

my yet maiden bed, remain there but an hour, nor speak to me: my reasons are most strong; and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliver'd: and on your finger in the night i'll put another ring, that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds.\n","976   adieu, till then; then, fail not.\n","977   you have won a wife of me, though there my hope be done.\n","978

second lord  especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him.\n","989   i will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell

justified?\n","1010   first lord  the stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is
