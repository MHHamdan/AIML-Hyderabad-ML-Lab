A sine wave consists of a single frequency only, and its spectrum is a single point. Theoretically, a sine wave exists over infinite time and never changes. The objective of this experiment is to visualize the various spectrograms of sine waves of different frequencies and also combination different sine waves."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kFdSLnnHTMxC"},"source":["### Setup Steps"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AtnDQhr4Cd0-"},"source":["#@title Please enter your registration id to start: { run: \"auto\", display-mode: \"form\" }\n","Id = \"\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mjSukMztCd1N"},"source":["#@title Please enter your password (normally your phone number) to continue: { run: \"auto\", display-mode: \"form\" }\n","password = \"\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QRvlfkw5rV_Q","cellView":"form"},"source":["#@title Run this cell to complete the setup for this Notebook\n","from IPython import get_ipython\n","\n","ipython = get_ipython()\n","  \n","notebook= \"U2W10_CS_Spectrogram_Sine_Waves\" #name of the notebook\n","Answer = \"Ungraded\"\n","def setup():\n","    ipython.magic(\"sx pip install playsound\")\n","    from IPython.display import HTML, display\n","    display(HTML('<script src=\"https://dashboard.talentsprint.com/aiml/record_ip.html?traineeId={0}&recordId={1}\"></script>'.format(getId(),submission_id)))\n","    print(\"Setup completed successfully\")\n","    return\n","\n","def submit_notebook():\n","    \n","    ipython.magic(\"notebook -e \"+ notebook + \".ipynb\")\n","    \n","    import requests, json, base64, datetime\n","\n","    url = \"https://dashboard.talentsprint.com/xp/app/save_notebook_attempts\"\n","    if not submission_id:\n","      data = {\"id\" : getId(), \"notebook\" : notebook, \"mobile\" : getPassword()}\n","      r = requests.post(url, data = data)\n","      r = json.loads(r.text)\n","\n","      if r[\"status\"] == \"Success\":\n","          return r[\"record_id\"]\n","      elif \"err\" in r:        \n","        print(r[\"err\"])\n","        return None        \n","      else:\n","        print (\"Something is wrong, the notebook will not be submitted for grading\")\n","        return None\n","\n","    elif getAnswer() and getComplexity() and getAdditional() and getConcepts():\n","      f = open(notebook + \".ipynb\", \"rb\")\n","      file_hash = base64.b64encode(f.read())\n","\n","      data = {\"complexity\" : Complexity, \"additional\" :Additional, \n","              \"concepts\" : Concepts, \"record_id\" : submission_id, \n","              \"answer\" : Answer, \"id\" : Id, \"file_hash\" : file_hash,\n","              \"feedback_experiments_input\" : Comments, \"notebook\" : notebook}\n","\n","      r = requests.post(url, data = data)\n","      r = json.loads(r.text)\n","      if \"err\" in r:        \n","        print(r[\"err\"])\n","        return None   \n","      else:\n","        print(\"Your submission is successful.\")\n","        print(\"Ref Id:\", submission_id)\n","        print(\"Date of submission: \", r[\"date\"])\n","        print(\"Time of submission: \", r[\"time\"])\n","        print(\"View your submissions: https://aiml.iiith.talentsprint.com/notebook_submissions\")\n","        #
