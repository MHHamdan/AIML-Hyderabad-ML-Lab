One type of cross validation is the K-Fold Cross Validation\n","\n","In our experiment, we are using K-Fold Cross Validation  technique to reduce (limit) the problem of overfitting. K-Fold Cross Validation is a way to evaluate and improve the performance of our machine learning model. It helps to prevent from overfitting to a single train or test split. \n","\n","\n","When we are given a machine learning problem, we will be given two types of data sets — known data (training data set) and unknown data (test data set). By using cross validation, you would be “testing” your machine learning model in the “training” phase to check for overfitting and to get an idea about how your machine learning model will generalize to independent data, which is the test data set given in the problem.\n","\n","\n","In first round of cross validation, we have to divide our original training data set into two parts:\n","\n","1. Cross validation training set\n","2. Cross validation testing set or Validation set\n","\n","![alt text](https://cdn.talentsprint.com/aiml/Experiment_related_data/IMAGES/K-Fold.png)\n","\n","The above image represents how the K-Fold Cross Validation works. We divide the dataset in to \"K'' parts and will use the K-1 parts for training and remaining 1 for testing. We will rotate the test set and repeat the process for \"K\" times. \n","\n","we will train our machine learning model on the cross validation training set and test the model’s predictions against the validation set. we will get to know how accurate our machine learning model’s predictions are when we compare the model’s predictions on the validation set and the actual labels of the data points in the validation set.\n","\n","To reduce the variability, multiple rounds of cross validation are performed by using different cross validation training sets and cross validation testing sets. The results from all the rounds are averaged to estimate the accuracy of the machine learning model.\n","\n","**K-fold cross validation is performed as per the following steps:**\n","\n","1. Randomly split the entire training dataset into k subsets.\n","2. Reserve one block as our test data\n","3. Train on each of the remaining K-1 blocks\n","4. Measure the performance against the test set\n","5. The average of our K recorded errors is called the cross-validation error and it will be used as a performance metric for the
