Dropout, on the other hand, prevents overfitting by modifying the network itself. Every neuron apart from the ones in the output layer is assigned a probability p of being temporarily ignored from calculations. p is also called dropout rate and is initialized to 0.2. Then, as each iteration progresses, the neurons in each layer with the highest probability get dropped. This results in creating a smaller network with each epoch. Since in each iteration, a random input value can be eliminated, the network tries to balance the risk and not to favour any of the features and reduces bias and noise.
