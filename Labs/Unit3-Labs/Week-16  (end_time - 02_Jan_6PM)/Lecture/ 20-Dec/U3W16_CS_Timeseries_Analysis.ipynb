Instead, it may be better to try to predict the change that occurs from one period to the next (i.e., the quantity Yt - Yt-1). That is, it may be better to look at the first difference of the series, to see if a predictable pattern can be found there. For purposes of one-period-ahead forecasting, it is just as good to predict the next change as to predict the next level of the series, since the predicted change can be added to the current level to yield a predicted level. The simplest case of such a model is one that always predicts that the next change will be zero, as if the series is equally likely to go up or down in the next period regardless of what it has done in the past.\n","\n","\n","**Random Walk Model** $ \\hat{Y_t} = Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon \\\\$\n","\n","**Random Walk Model with drift** $$ \\hat{Y_t} = Y_{t-1} + c + \\epsilon \\\\$$"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.039113Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.032055Z"},"id":"0ctaUwbPJTNA"},"source":["dfls[\"priceModLogShift1\"] = dfls.priceModLog.shift()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.066659Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.042158Z"},"id":"_H9SPFWHJTND"},"source":["dfls.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.354618Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.069362Z"},"id":"HSNhXK5GJTNH"},"source":["dfls.plot(kind= \"scatter\", y = \"priceModLog\", x = \"priceModLogShift1\", s = 50)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.364490Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.358141Z"},"id":"AlQpb6pKJTNL"},"source":["# Lets plot the one-month difference curve\n","dfls[\"priceModLogDiff\"] = dfls.priceModLog - dfls.priceModLogShift1"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.743543Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.717477Z"},"id":"7Y119udZJTNU"},"source":["dfls[\"priceRandom\"] = np.exp(dfls.priceModLogShift1)\n","dfls.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:29.058777Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:28.773566Z"},"id":"dpp1zdbUJTNd"},"source":["dfls.plot(kind=\"line\", x=\"timeIndex\", y = [\"priceMod\",\"priceRandom\"])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:29.071218Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:29.062275Z"},"id":"zcTNKpaBJTNg"},"source":["# Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n","model_random_RMSE = RMSE(dfls.priceRandom, dfls.priceMod)\n","model_random_RMSE"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:29.091823Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:29.074253Z"},"id":"OF4bkE8CJTNn"},"source":["dflsResults.loc[2,\"Model\"] = \"Random\"\n","dflsResults.loc[2,\"RMSE\"] = model_random_RMSE\n","dflsResults.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:29.411870Z","start_time":"2018-11-26T12:33:29.095182Z"},"id":"Lua5GzQ_JTNr"},"source":["dfls.plot(kind=\"line\", x=\"timeIndex\", y = [\"priceMod\", \"priceMean\", \"priceLinear\", \"priceRandom\"])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KDP6SIEbJTOT"},"source":["\n","## Simple Exponential Smoothing Model (SES)\n","\n","Instead of equally weighting each of the observation, in the SES model we give more weightage to the recent observations and less to the older ones.
