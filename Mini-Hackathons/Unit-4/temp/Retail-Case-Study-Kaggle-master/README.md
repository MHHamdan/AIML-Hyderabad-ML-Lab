Forecasting of retail sales helps retailer to take necessary measures to plan their budgets or investments in a period (monthly, yearly) among different product categories like women clothing, men clothing and other clothing and at the same time they can plan to minimize revenue loss from unavailability of products by investing accordingly.

You need to help predict the RMSE values for the test set - there are 4 datasets 1. Macro Economic Dataset 2. Events and Holidays Dataset 3. Weather Data Set 4. Train Data (Sales and the Year/Month)

Additionally there is the test data set that you need to prepare the results.

### Data Description
Retail Sales Forecasting: 1. Sales data: “Train.csv” This table contains the Temporal data like Year, Month, and Product category and Sales (In ThousandDollars), provided for the period 2009 to 2014

1. Macro Economic Data: “MacroEconomicData.xlsx” This data is provided for the period from 2009 to 2016 with the details like CPI, GDP, Cotton production, mill usage, unemployment rate etc.
