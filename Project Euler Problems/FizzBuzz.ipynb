The object of the assignment is less about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more about showing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as if-/else-statements and loops. The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:\n","\n","For numbers 1 through 100,\n","\n"," * if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;\n"," * if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;\n"," * if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;\n"," * else, print the number."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"jnfPzmowJEsg","colab":{}},"source":["### First a wrong code to show one common error many students \n","### (and too many experienced programmers) make\n","LIMIT = 101\n","for n in range(1, LIMIT):\n","    if n % 3 == 0: \n","        print(\"FIZZ\")\n","    elif n % 5 == 0:\n","        print(\"BUZZ\")\n","    elif n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:\n","        print(\"FIZZBUZZ\")\n","    else:\n","        print(n)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"rteY_DFEJEsk","colab":{}},"source":["## The above bug removed and we use a function\n","def fizzbuzz(n):\n","    if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:\n","        return \"FIZZBUZZ\"\n","    if n % 3 == 0:\n","        return \"FIZZ\"\n","    if n % 5 == 0:\n","        return \"BUZZ\"\n","    return str(n)\n","LIMIT = 101\n","for n in range(1, LIMIT):\n","    print(fizzbuzz(n), end=\" \")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"_IdbAvXPJEso","colab":{}},"source":["### Slightly better function\n","def fizzbuzz(n):\n","    fb = \"\"\n","    if n % 3 == 0:\n","        fb += \"FIZZ\"\n","    if n % 5 == 0:\n","        fb += \"BUZZ\"\n","    if len(fb) == 0:\n","        return str(n)\n","    else:\n","        return fb\n","fbs = [fizzbuzz(x) for x in range(1,101)]\n","print(fbs)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NbC9AuKtW_e8","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Recognise that we have only 15 patterns repeating\n","fb15 = [\"FIZZBUZZ\", \"\", \"\", \"FIZZ\", \"\", \"BUZZ\", \"FIZZ\", \"\", \"\", \n","        \"FIZZ\", \"BUZZ\", \"\", \"FIZZ\", \"\", \"\"]\n","def select(n):\n","    maybe = fb15[n % 15]\n","    if maybe == \"\":\n","        return str(n)\n","    else:\n","        return maybe"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2OA2xEotW_fB","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["fbs = [select(x) for x in range(1, 101)]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iuFHkC04W_fF","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["fbs"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"TF3KUd_NJEst","colab":{}},"source":["### A rather sophisticated version\n","def pick(n):\n","    return 2 * int(n % 5 == 0) + 1 * int(n % 3 == 0)\n","def fb(n):\n","    return [str(n), \"FIZZ\", \"BUZZ\", \"FIZZBUZZ\"][pick(n)]\n","fbs = [fb(x) for x in range(1, 101)]\n","print(fbs)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"1W9pOr5rJEsw","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
